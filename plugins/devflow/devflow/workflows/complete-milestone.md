<purpose>

Mark a shipped version (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0) as complete. Records the historical MILESTONES.md entry (`df-tools milestone put`), performs full PROJECT.md evolution review, regroups ROADMAP.md by milestone, and tags the release in git.

</purpose>

<required_reading>

1. templates/milestone.md
2. templates/milestone-archive.md
3. `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
4. `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
5. `.planning/PROJECT.md`

</required_reading>

<archival_behavior>

When a milestone completes:

1. Extract full milestone details to `.planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-ROADMAP.md`
2. Archive requirements to `.planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-REQUIREMENTS.md`
   (local: `df-tools milestone complete` builds both; store: each is published with `df-tools doc put milestones/v[X.Y]-<KIND>.md`)
3. Collapse ROADMAP.md — replace milestone details with one-line summary
4. Delete REQUIREMENTS.md (fresh one for next milestone)
5. Perform full PROJECT.md evolution review
6. Offer to create next milestone inline

**Context Efficiency:** Archives keep ROADMAP.md constant-size and REQUIREMENTS.md milestone-scoped.

**Store mode (D-05):** In store mode the milestone is a native GitHub milestone; its description holds a short summary and links the wiki page `Milestone-vX_Y` with the full entry. `df-tools milestone put` sets both; `df-tools milestone complete <version>` closes the milestone and publishes the `milestones/v[X.Y]-*.md` archives as wiki pages.

**ROADMAP archive** uses `templates/milestone-archive.md` — includes milestone header (status, objectives, date), full objective details, milestone summary (decisions, issues, tech debt).

**REQUIREMENTS archive** contains all requirements marked complete with outcomes, traceability table with final status, notes on changed requirements.

</archival_behavior>

<process>

<step name="verify_readiness">

**Use `roadmap analyze` for comprehensive readiness check:**

```bash
ROADMAP=$(node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs roadmap analyze)
```

This returns all objectives with job/summary counts and disk status. Use this to verify:
- Which objectives belong to this milestone?
- All objectives complete (all jobs have summaries)? Check `disk_status === 'complete'` for each.
- `progress_percent` should be 100%.

**Requirements completion check (REQUIRED before presenting):**

Parse REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table:
- Count total v1 requirements vs checked-off (`[x]`) requirements
- Identify any non-Complete rows in the traceability table

Present:

```
Milestone: [Name, e.g., "v1.0 MVP"]

Includes:
- Objective 1: Foundation (2/2 jobs complete)
- Objective 2: Authentication (2/2 jobs complete)
- Objective 3: Core Features (3/3 jobs complete)
- Objective 4: Polish (1/1 job complete)

Total: {objective_count} objectives, {total_jobs} jobs, all complete
Requirements: {N}/{M} v1 requirements checked off
```

**If requirements incomplete** (N < M):

```
⚠ Unchecked Requirements:

- [ ] {REQ-ID}: {description} (Objective {X})
- [ ] {REQ-ID}: {description} (Objective {Y})
```

MUST present 3 options:
1. **Proceed anyway** — mark milestone complete with known gaps
2. **Run audit first** — `/devflow:milestone audit` to assess gap severity
3. **Abort** — return to development

If user selects "Proceed anyway": note incomplete requirements in MILESTONES.md under `### Known Gaps` with REQ-IDs and descriptions.

<step name="gather_stats">

Calculate milestone statistics:

```bash
git log --oneline --grep="feat(" | head -20
git diff --stat FIRST_COMMIT..LAST_COMMIT | tail -1
find . -name "*.swift" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.py" | xargs wc -l 2>/dev/null

- Files modified: [M]
- Lines of code: [LOC] [language]
- Timeline: [Days] days ([Start] → [End])
- Git range: feat(XX-XX) → feat(YY-YY)
```

</step>

<step name="extract_accomplishments">

Extract one-liners from SUMMARY.md files using summary-extract:

```bash
# For each objective in milestone, extract one-liner
for summary in .planning/objectives/*-*/*-SUMMARY.md; do
  node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs summary-extract "$summary" --fields one_liner | jq -r '.one_liner'
done
```

Extract 4-6 key accomplishments. Present:

```
Key accomplishments for this milestone:
1. [Achievement from objective 1]
2. [Achievement from objective 2]
3. [Achievement from objective 3]
4. [Achievement from objective 4]
5. [Achievement from objective 5]
```

</step>

<step name="create_milestone_entry">

Draft the full MILESTONES.md entry now; the archive_milestone step records it with `milestone put`. `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs planning draft milestones/v[X.Y].md` prints the draft path. Follow `templates/milestone.md`: version, date, objective/job/task counts, accomplishments from the SUMMARY.md files, plus any user-provided "Delivered" summary, git range, LOC stats and — if the user proceeded with gaps — `### Known Gaps`.

In local mode `df-tools milestone complete` first adds a base entry with the counts and accomplishments; `milestone put` then replaces it, because both carry the same `## v[X.Y]` heading.

</step>

<step name="evolve_project_full_review">

Full PROJECT.md evolution review at milestone completion.

Read all objective summaries:

```bash
cat .planning/objectives/*-*/*-SUMMARY.md
```

**Full review checklist:**

1. **"What This Is" accuracy:**
   - Compare current description to what was built
   - Update if product has meaningfully changed

2. **Core Value check:**
   - Still the right priority? Did shipping reveal a different core value?
   - Update if the ONE thing has shifted

3. **Requirements audit:**

   **Validated section:**
   - All Active requirements shipped this milestone → Move to Validated
   - Format: `- ✓ [Requirement] — v[X.Y]`

   **Active section:**
   - Remove requirements moved to Validated
   - Add new requirements for next milestone
   - Keep unaddressed requirements

   **Out of Scope audit:**
   - Review each item — reasoning still valid?
   - Remove irrelevant items
   - Add requirements invalidated during milestone

4. **Context update:**
   - Current codebase state (LOC, tech stack)
   - User feedback themes (if any)
   - Known issues or technical debt

5. **Key Decisions audit:**
   - Extract all decisions from milestone objective summaries
   - Add to Key Decisions table with outcomes
   - Mark ✓ Good, ⚠️ Revisit, or — Pending

6. **Constraints check:**
   - Any constraints changed during development? Update as needed

Make these PROJECT.md changes in the draft `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs planning draft PROJECT.md` prints (seeded with the current file). Set the "Last updated" footer:

```markdown
---
*Last updated: [date] after v[X.Y] milestone*
```

When the review is done, publish the draft:

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs doc put PROJECT.md --from "$DRAFT"
```

**Example full evolution (v1.0 → v1.1 prep):**

Before:

```markdown
## What This Is

A real-time collaborative whiteboard for remote teams.

## Core Value

Real-time sync that feels instant.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Canvas drawing tools
- [ ] Real-time sync < 500ms
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Export to PNG

### Out of Scope

- Mobile app — web-first approach
- Video chat — use external tools
```

After v1.0:

```markdown
## What This Is

A real-time collaborative whiteboard for remote teams with instant sync and drawing tools.

## Core Value

Real-time sync that feels instant.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Canvas drawing tools — v1.0
- ✓ Real-time sync < 500ms — v1.0 (achieved 200ms avg)
- ✓ User authentication — v1.0

### Active

- [ ] Export to PNG
- [ ] Undo/redo history
- [ ] Shape tools (rectangles, circles)

### Out of Scope

- Mobile app — web-first approach, PWA works well
- Video chat — use external tools
- Offline mode — real-time is core value

## Context

Shipped v1.0 with 2,400 LOC TypeScript.
Tech stack: Next.js, Supabase, Canvas API.
Initial user testing showed demand for shape tools.
```

**Step complete when:**

- [ ] "What This Is" reviewed and updated if needed
- [ ] Core Value verified as still correct
- [ ] All shipped requirements moved to Validated
- [ ] New requirements added to Active for next milestone
- [ ] Out of Scope reasoning audited
- [ ] Context updated with current state
- [ ] All milestone decisions added to Key Decisions
- [ ] "Last updated" footer reflects milestone completion

</step>

<step name="reorganize_roadmap">

Check `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs planning mode`. **Store:** ROADMAP.md is a generated view — `gh pull --all` regroups it from the native milestones after archive_milestone; do not hand-edit it. **Local:** edit `.planning/ROADMAP.md` as today — group completed milestone objectives:

```markdown
# Roadmap: [Project Name]

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 MVP** — Objectives 1-4 (shipped YYYY-MM-DD)
- 🚧 **v1.1 Security** — Objectives 5-6 (in progress)
- 📋 **v2.0 Redesign** — Objectives 7-10 (planned)

## Objectives

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.0 MVP (Objectives 1-4) — SHIPPED YYYY-MM-DD</summary>

```

</step>

<step name="archive_milestone">

**Delegate archival to df-tools.** Check `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs planning mode` first.

**Local mode** (as today):

```bash
ARCHIVE=$(node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs milestone complete "v[X.Y]" --name "[Milestone Name]")
```

The CLI handles:
- Creating `.planning/milestones/` directory
- Archiving ROADMAP.md to `milestones/v[X.Y]-ROADMAP.md`
- Archiving REQUIREMENTS.md to `milestones/v[X.Y]-REQUIREMENTS.md` with archive header
- Moving audit file to milestones if it exists
- Creating/appending MILESTONES.md entry with accomplishments from SUMMARY.md files
- Updating STATE.md (status, last activity)

Extract from result: `version`, `date`, `objectives`, `plans`, `tasks`, `accomplishments`, `archived`.

Verify: `✅ Milestone archived to .planning/milestones/`

Then record the full entry drafted in create_milestone_entry; it replaces the CLI's base entry:

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs milestone put "v[X.Y]" --from "$DRAFT"
```

**Store mode:** `milestone complete` closes the native milestone and publishes the archives already under `milestones/`; it does not build them. Draft each archive first (`planning draft milestones/v[X.Y]-<KIND>.md` prints a path): the ROADMAP archive is the milestone's objectives and details from the current ROADMAP.md and the REQUIREMENTS archive is REQUIREMENTS.md under the archive header from `templates/milestone-archive.md` (audit-milestone already published `milestones/v[X.Y]-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` in store mode). Then:

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs doc put milestones/v[X.Y]-ROADMAP.md --from "$ROADMAP_DRAFT"
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs doc put milestones/v[X.Y]-REQUIREMENTS.md --from "$REQUIREMENTS_DRAFT"
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs milestone put "v[X.Y]" --from "$DRAFT"
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs milestone complete "v[X.Y]"
```

The stats for the summary come from gather_stats.

**Objective archival (optional):** After archival completes, ask the user:

AskUserQuestion(header="Archive Objectives", question="Archive objective directories to milestones/?", options: "Yes — move to milestones/v[X.Y]-objectives/" | "Skip — keep objectives in place")

If "Yes": move objective directories to the milestone archive:
```bash
mkdir -p .planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-objectives
# For each objective directory in .planning/objectives/:
mv .planning/objectives/{objective-dir} .planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-objectives/
```
Verify: `✅ Objective directories archived to .planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-objectives/`

If "Skip": Objective directories remain in `.planning/objectives/` as raw execution history. Use `/devflow:cleanup` later to archive retroactively.

After archival, the AI still handles:
- Reorganizing ROADMAP.md with milestone grouping (requires judgment)
- Full PROJECT.md evolution review (requires understanding)
- Deleting original ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md
- These are NOT fully delegated because they require AI interpretation of content

</step>

<step name="reorganize_roadmap_and_delete_originals">

After `milestone complete` has archived, reorganize ROADMAP.md with milestone groupings, then delete originals:

**Reorganize ROADMAP.md** — group completed milestone objectives:

```markdown
# Roadmap: [Project Name]

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 MVP** — Objectives 1-4 (shipped YYYY-MM-DD)
- 🚧 **v1.1 Security** — Objectives 5-6 (in progress)

## Objectives

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.0 MVP (Objectives 1-4) — SHIPPED YYYY-MM-DD</summary>

- [x] Objective 1: Foundation (2/2 jobs) — completed YYYY-MM-DD
- [x] Objective 2: Authentication (2/2 jobs) — completed YYYY-MM-DD

</details>
```

**Then delete originals:**

```bash
rm .planning/ROADMAP.md
rm .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
```

</step>

<step name="update_state">

Check `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs planning mode`. **Store:** STATE.md is generated — run `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs gh pull --all` so it reflects the closed milestone, and leave the fields below to it. **Local:** most STATE.md fields were set by `milestone complete`; check them and edit the remaining ones:

**Project Reference:**

```markdown
## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated [today])

**Core value:** [Current core value from PROJECT.md]
**Current focus:** [Next milestone or "Planning next milestone"]
```

**Accumulated Context:**
- Clear decisions summary (full log in PROJECT.md)
- Clear resolved blockers
- Keep open blockers for next milestone

</step>

<step name="handle_branches">

**If `pr_lifecycle` is true (store mode, from `init milestone-op`; the init call below returns it too), skip this step entirely and continue to git_tag:** each objective was already merged through its PR, so there is no local squash merge, no merge prompt and no branch deletion to offer, and `branching_strategy` is ignored. If an objective's PR is still open, do not merge it here; say which one, and have the user run `df-tools gh pr merge <objective>` (or `df-tools gh pr reconcile <objective>` after a human merge or a merge queue) first.

**If `pr_lifecycle` is false (local mode):** unchanged, continue below.

Check branching strategy and offer merge options.

Use `init milestone-op` for context, or load config directly:

```bash
INIT=$(node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs init execute-objective "1")
```

Extract `branching_strategy`, `objective_branch_template`, `milestone_branch_template`, and `commit_docs` from init JSON.

**If "none":** Skip to git_tag.

**For "objective" strategy:**

```bash
BRANCH_PREFIX=$(echo "$OBJECTIVE_BRANCH_TEMPLATE" | sed 's/{.*//')
OBJECTIVE_BRANCHES=$(git branch --list "${BRANCH_PREFIX}*" 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^\*//' | tr -d ' ')
```

**For "milestone" strategy:**

```bash
BRANCH_PREFIX=$(echo "$MILESTONE_BRANCH_TEMPLATE" | sed 's/{.*//')
MILESTONE_BRANCH=$(git branch --list "${BRANCH_PREFIX}*" 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^\*//' | tr -d ' ' | head -1)
