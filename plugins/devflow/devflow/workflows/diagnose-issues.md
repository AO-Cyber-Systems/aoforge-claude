<purpose>
Orchestrate parallel debug agents to investigate UAT gaps and find root causes.

After UAT finds gaps, spawn one debug agent per gap. Each agent investigates autonomously with symptoms pre-filled from UAT. Collect root causes, record each diagnosis in the UAT.md gaps (draft + `df-tools doc put`), then hand off to plan-objective --gaps with actual diagnoses.

Orchestrator stays lean: parse gaps, spawn agents, collect results, publish the diagnosed UAT.

DEBUG_DIR=.planning/debug

Debug files use the `.planning/debug/` path (hidden directory with leading dot).
</paths>

<core_principle>
**Diagnose before planning fixes.**

UAT tells us WHAT is broken (symptoms). Debug agents find WHY (root cause). plan-objective --gaps then creates targeted fixes based on actual causes, not guesses.

Without diagnosis: "Comment doesn't refresh" → guess at fix → maybe wrong
With diagnosis: "Comment doesn't refresh" → "useEffect missing dependency" → precise fix
</core_principle>

<process>

<step name="parse_gaps">
**Extract gaps from UAT.md:**

Read the "Gaps" section (YAML format):
```yaml
- truth: "Comment appears immediately after submission"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: works but doesn't show until I refresh the page"
  severity: major
  test: 2
  artifacts: []
  missing: []
```

For each gap, also read the corresponding test from "Tests" section to get full context.

Build gap list:
```
gaps = [
  {truth: "Comment appears immediately...", severity: "major", test_num: 2, reason: "..."},
  {truth: "Reply button positioned correctly...", severity: "minor", test_num: 5, reason: "..."},
  ...
]
```
</step>

<step name="report_plan">
**Report diagnosis plan to user:**

```
## Diagnosing {N} Gaps

Spawning parallel debug agents to investigate root causes:

| Gap (Truth) | Severity |
|-------------|----------|
| Comment appears immediately after submission | major |
| Reply button positioned correctly | minor |
| Delete removes comment | blocker |

Each agent will:
1. Create DEBUG-{slug}.md with symptoms pre-filled
2. Investigate autonomously (read code, form hypotheses, test)
3. Return root cause

This runs in parallel - all gaps investigated simultaneously.
```
</step>

<step name="spawn_agents">
**Progress tracking (if available):**

For each gap, create a progress task and set it in_progress as its agent is spawned (all agents start at once):
```
TaskCreate(
  subject="Diagnose: {truth_short}",
  description="Investigating root cause of: {truth}",
  activeForm="Diagnosing {truth_short}"
)
TaskUpdate(taskId=gap_task_id, status="in_progress")
```

**Spawn debug agents in parallel:**

For each gap, fill the debug-subagent-prompt template and spawn:

```
Task(
  prompt=filled_debug_subagent_prompt,
  subagent_type="debugger",
  description="Debug: {truth_short}"
)
```

**All agents spawn in single message** (parallel execution).

Template placeholders:
- `{truth}`: The expected behavior that failed
- `{expected}`: From UAT test
- `{actual}`: Verbatim user description from reason field
- `{errors}`: Any error messages from UAT (or "None reported")
- `{reproduction}`: "Test {test_num} in UAT"
- `{timeline}`: "Discovered during UAT"
- `{goal}`: `find_root_cause_only` (UAT flow - plan-objective --gaps handles fixes)
- `{slug}`: Generated from truth
</step>

<step name="collect_results">
**Collect root causes from agents:**

Each agent returns with:
```
## ROOT CAUSE FOUND

**Debug Session:** ${DEBUG_DIR}/{slug}.md

**Root Cause:** {specific cause with evidence}

**Evidence Summary:**
- {key finding 1}
- {key finding 2}
- {key finding 3}

**Files Involved:**
- {file1}: {what's wrong}
- {file2}: {related issue}

**Suggested Fix Direction:** {brief hint for plan-objective --gaps}
```

Parse each return to extract:
- root_cause: The diagnosed cause
- files: Files involved
- debug_path: Path to debug session file
- suggested_fix: Hint for gap closure plan

**Update progress (if available):** For each completed diagnosis:
```
TaskUpdate(taskId=gap_task_id, status="completed", description="Root cause: {root_cause}")
```

If agent returns `## INVESTIGATION INCONCLUSIVE`:
- root_cause: "Investigation inconclusive - manual review needed"
- Note which issue needs manual attention
- Include remaining possibilities from agent return
- Progress tracking (if available): `TaskUpdate(taskId=gap_task_id, status="completed", description="Inconclusive: manual review needed")`
</step>

<step name="update_uat">
**Record the diagnosis in the UAT gaps:**

Open the UAT draft — the same working copy verify-work uses, seeded from the current file if no draft exists:

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs planning draft objectives/XX-name/{phase_num}-UAT.md
```

Note the printed path (`$UAT_DRAFT` below) — shell variables do not survive between Bash calls.

For each gap in the draft's Gaps section, add artifacts and missing fields:

```yaml
- truth: "Comment appears immediately after submission"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: works but doesn't show until I refresh the page"
  severity: major
  test: 2
  root_cause: "useEffect in CommentList.tsx missing commentCount dependency"
  artifacts:
    - path: "src/components/CommentList.tsx"
      issue: "useEffect missing dependency"
  missing:
    - "Add commentCount to useEffect dependency array"
    - "Trigger re-render when new comment added"
  debug_session: .planning/debug/comment-not-refreshing.md
```

Set status in the draft's frontmatter to "diagnosed".

Publish the draft (local mode writes the same UAT.md as before; store mode also queues its wiki page), then commit it (local mode; in store mode `commit` skips the gitignored cache path):
```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs doc put objectives/XX-name/{phase_num}-UAT.md --from "$UAT_DRAFT"
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs commit "docs({phase_num}): add root causes from diagnosis" --files ".planning/objectives/XX-name/{phase_num}-UAT.md"
```
</step>

<step name="report_results">
**Report diagnosis results and hand off:**

Proceeding to plan fixes...

Return to verify-work orchestrator for automatic planning.
Do NOT offer manual next steps - verify-work handles the rest.
</step>

</process>

<context_efficiency>
Agents start with symptoms pre-filled from UAT (no symptom gathering).
Agents only diagnose—plan-objective --gaps handles fixes (no fix application).
</context_efficiency>

<failure_handling>
**Agent fails to find root cause:**
- Mark gap as "needs manual review"
- Continue with other gaps
- Report incomplete diagnosis

**Agent times out:**
- Check DEBUG-{slug}.md for partial progress
- Can resume with /devflow:debug

**All agents fail:**
- Something systemic (permissions, git, etc.)
- Report for manual investigation
- Fall back to plan-objective --gaps without root causes (less precise)
</failure_handling>
