<purpose>
Initialize a new project through unified flow: questioning, research (optional), requirements, roadmap. This is the most leveraged moment in any project — deep questioning here means better plans, better execution, better outcomes. One workflow takes you from idea to ready-for-planning.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.
</required_reading>

<auto_mode>
## Auto Mode Detection

Check if `--auto` flag is present in $ARGUMENTS.

**If auto mode:**
- Skip brownfield mapping offer (assume greenfield)
- Skip deep questioning (extract context from provided document)
- Config: YOLO mode is implicit (skip that question), but ask depth/git/agents FIRST (Step 2a)
- After config: run Steps 6-9 automatically with smart defaults:
  - Research: Always yes
  - Requirements: Include all table stakes + features from provided document
  - Requirements approval: Auto-approve
  - Roadmap approval: Auto-approve

**Document requirement:**
Auto mode requires an idea document — either:
- File reference: `/devflow:new-project --auto @prd.md`
- Pasted/written text in the prompt

If no document content provided, error:

```
Error: --auto requires an idea document.

Usage:
  /devflow:new-project --auto @your-idea.md
  /devflow:new-project --auto [paste or write your idea here]

The document should describe what you want to build.
```
</auto_mode>

<process>

## 1. Setup

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP — Execute these checks before ANY user interaction:**

```bash
INIT=$(node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs init new-project)
```

Parse JSON for: `researcher_model`, `synthesizer_model`, `roadmapper_model`, `commit_docs`, `project_exists`, `has_codebase_map`, `planning_exists`, `has_existing_code`, `has_package_file`, `is_brownfield`, `needs_codebase_map`, `has_git`.

**If `project_exists` is true:** Error — project already initialized. Use `/devflow:status`.

**If `has_git` is false:** Initialize git:
```bash
git init
```

## 2. Brownfield Offer

**If auto mode:** Skip to Step 4 (assume greenfield, synthesize PROJECT.md from provided document).

**If `needs_codebase_map` is true** (from init — existing code detected but no codebase map):

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Codebase"
- question: "I detected existing code in this directory. Would you like to map the codebase first?"
- options:
  - "Adopt instead" — Run /devflow:adopt (maps the code, infers PROJECT.md, one commit on devflow/adopt) (Recommended)
  - "Map codebase first" — Run /devflow:map-codebase to understand existing architecture
  - "Skip mapping" — Proceed with project initialization

**If "Adopt instead":**
```
Run `/devflow:adopt` instead — it maps the code, infers PROJECT.md, and makes one commit on
devflow/adopt without further questions.
```
Exit command.

**If "Map codebase first":**
```
Run `/devflow:map-codebase` first, then return to `/devflow:new-project`
```
Exit command.

**If "Skip mapping" OR `needs_codebase_map` is false:** Continue to Step 3.

## 2a. Auto Mode Config (auto mode only)

**If auto mode:** Collect config settings upfront before processing the idea document.

YOLO mode is implicit (auto = YOLO). Ask remaining config questions:

**Round 1 — Core settings (3 questions, no Mode question):**

```
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    header: "Depth",
    question: "How thorough should planning be?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Quick (Recommended)", description: "Ship fast (3-5 objectives, 1-3 jobs each)" },
      { label: "Standard", description: "Balanced scope and speed (5-8 objectives, 3-5 jobs each)" },
      { label: "Comprehensive", description: "Thorough coverage (8-12 objectives, 5-10 jobs each)" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Execution",
    question: "Run plans in parallel?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Parallel (Recommended)", description: "Independent plans run simultaneously" },
      { label: "Sequential", description: "One plan at a time" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Git Tracking",
    question: "Commit planning docs to git?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Planning docs tracked in version control" },
      { label: "No", description: "Keep .planning/ local-only (add to .gitignore)" }
    ]
  }
])
```

**Round 2 — Workflow agents (same as Step 5):**

```
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    header: "Research",
    question: "Research before planning each objective? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Investigate domain, find patterns, surface gotchas" },
      { label: "No", description: "Plan directly from requirements" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Plan Check",
    question: "Verify plans will achieve their goals? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Catch gaps before execution starts" },
      { label: "No", description: "Execute plans without verification" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Verifier",
    question: "Verify work satisfies requirements after each objective? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Confirm deliverables match objective goals" },
      { label: "No", description: "Trust execution, skip verification" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "AI Models",
    question: "Which AI models for planning agents?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Balanced (Recommended)", description: "Sonnet for most agents — good quality/cost ratio" },
      { label: "Quality", description: "Opus for research/roadmap — higher cost, deeper analysis" },
      { label: "Budget", description: "Haiku where possible — fastest, lowest cost" }
    ]
  }
])
```

Create `.planning/config.json` with mode set to "yolo":

```json
{
  "mode": "yolo",
  "depth": "[selected]",
  "parallelization": true|false,
  "commit_docs": true|false,
  "model_profile": "quality|balanced|budget",
  "workflow": {
    "research": true|false,
    "job_check": true|false,
    "verifier": true|false,
    "auto_advance": true
  }
}
```

**If commit_docs = No:** Add `.planning/` to `.gitignore`.

**Commit config.json:**

```bash
mkdir -p .planning
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs commit "chore: add project config" --files .planning/config.json
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs upgrade --register
```

Registers this repo for backup pruning; ignore an unknown-flag error from an older mirror.

**Persist auto-advance to config (survives context compaction):**

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs config-set workflow.auto_advance true
```

Proceed to Step 4 (skip Steps 3 and 5).

## 3. Deep Questioning

**If auto mode:** Skip (already handled in Step 2a). Extract project context from provided document instead and proceed to Step 4.

**Display stage banner:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 DF ► QUESTIONING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Open the conversation:**

Ask inline (freeform, NOT AskUserQuestion):

"What do you want to build?"

Wait for their response. This gives you the context needed to ask intelligent follow-up questions.

**Follow the thread:**

Based on what they said, ask follow-up questions that dig into their response. Use AskUserQuestion with options that probe what they mentioned — interpretations, clarifications, concrete examples.

Keep following threads. Each answer opens new threads to explore. Ask about:
- What excited them
- What problem sparked this
- What they mean by vague terms
- What it would actually look like
- What's already decided

Consult `questioning.md` for techniques:
- Challenge vagueness
- Make abstract concrete
- Surface assumptions
- Find edges
- Reveal motivation

**Check context (background, not out loud):**

As you go, mentally check the context checklist from `questioning.md`. If gaps remain, weave questions naturally. Don't suddenly switch to checklist mode.

**Decision gate:**

When you have enough for a clear PROJECT.md, use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Ready?"
- question: "I think I understand what you're after. Ready to draft PROJECT.md?"
- options:
  - "Draft PROJECT.md" — Let's move forward
  - "Keep exploring" — I want to share more / ask me more

If "Keep exploring" — ask what they want to add, or identify gaps and probe naturally.

Loop until "Draft PROJECT.md" selected.

## 3.5. Identify project `kind` (required)

Before writing PROJECT.md, identify what the project IS. This sets the project-level half of the (kind, work) defaults lookup the planner uses on every objective.

**Ask both questions in one batched call (neither depends on the other's answer):**

```
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    header: "Project kind",
    question: "What is this project? (type ui-lib or plugin under Other)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "api", description: "backend API/service consumed by clients" },
      { label: "app", description: "end-user application (web, mobile, desktop)" },
      { label: "library", description: "code consumed by other code via API" },
      { label: "cli", description: "command-line tool consumed by humans in a terminal" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Work type",
    question: "Will most objectives be the same work type? (type foundation, bugfix or prototype under Other)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Skip — work types vary (Recommended)", description: "most projects pick this" },
      { label: "feature", description: "most objectives ship new behavior" },
      { label: "port", description: "most objectives re-implement existing behavior" },
      { label: "refactor", description: "most objectives restructure without behavior change" }
    ]
  }
])
```

The tool takes 4 options per question, so the rest are typed under Other: `ui-lib` ("UI components consumed by other apps") and `plugin` ("extends a host system via plugin contract") for the kind; `foundation` ("most objectives are scaffolding, rare for a whole project"), `bugfix` ("most objectives are list-driven bug fixes") and `prototype` ("most objectives are exploratory throwaways") for the work type. `kind` must be one of `api`, `app`, `library`, `ui-lib`, `cli`, `plugin`; if the Other answer is none of them, ask the kind question again. A work type typed under Other must be `foundation`, `bugfix` or `prototype`; anything else, ask again.

If "Skip — work types vary" is chosen, omit `default_work` from PROJECT.md frontmatter — the planner falls back to `feature` per objective. If a specific work type is chosen, write it as `default_work` in the frontmatter; the planner is louder about inheritance so users can override per objective when needed.

**In auto mode:** Infer `kind` from the provided document (heuristic: presence of "API"/"endpoints"/"backend" → `api`; "UI"/"app"/"mobile" → `app`; "library"/"package"/"npm"/"gem" → `library`; "components"/"design system" → `ui-lib`; "CLI"/"command-line" → `cli`; "plugin"/"extension" → `plugin`). If the document is ambiguous, default to `api` and surface a warning. Skip `default_work` in auto mode.

## 4. Draft and publish PROJECT.md

**If auto mode:** Synthesize from provided document. No "Ready?" gate was shown — proceed directly to commit.

Synthesize all context into a PROJECT.md draft using the template from `templates/project.md`. **Include the `kind` (and optionally `default_work`) values from Step 3.5 in the YAML frontmatter at the top of the file.** The draft path comes from `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs planning draft PROJECT.md`; put the content there with the Write tool. It is published with `doc put PROJECT.md` just before the commit below (in local mode the published file is byte-identical to the draft).

**For greenfield projects:**

Initialize requirements as hypotheses:

```markdown
## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] [Requirement 1]
- [ ] [Requirement 2]
- [ ] [Requirement 3]

### Out of Scope

- [Exclusion 1] — [why]
- [Exclusion 2] — [why]
```

All Active requirements are hypotheses until shipped and validated.

**For brownfield projects (codebase map exists):**

Infer Validated requirements from existing code:

1. Read `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `STACK.md`
2. Identify what the codebase already does
3. These become the initial Validated set

```markdown
## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ [Existing capability 1] — existing
- ✓ [Existing capability 2] — existing
- ✓ [Existing capability 3] — existing

### Active

- [ ] [New requirement 1]
- [ ] [New requirement 2]

### Out of Scope

- [Exclusion 1] — [why]
```

**Key Decisions:**

Initialize with any decisions made during questioning:

```markdown
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| [Choice from questioning] | [Why] | — Pending |
```

**Last updated footer:**

```markdown
---
*Last updated: [date] after initialization*
```

Do not compress. Capture everything gathered.

**Review the draft (plan mode):**

**Skip if:** `--auto` (auto mode approves the draft, as before). new-project does not key on
`workflow.auto_advance`: it writes that key as true for every project (references/built-ins.md).

EnterPlanMode()

Put in the plan: the full PROJECT.md draft, then "On approval: publish with `doc put PROJECT.md` and commit".

ExitPlanMode()

Approved → apply any edits the user made to the draft in the plan, then publish. "No, keep planning" → add
`## Requested changes`, ExitPlanMode again; on approval apply them to the draft and present it again.

**Commit PROJECT.md (after approval or auto mode):**

```bash
mkdir -p .planning
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs doc put PROJECT.md --from "$DRAFT"
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs commit "docs: initialize project" --files .planning/PROJECT.md
```

## 5. Workflow Preferences

**If auto mode:** Skip — config was collected in Step 2a. Proceed to Step 5.5.

**Smart defaults approach:** Show a single summary of defaults, then ask whether to use them or customize.

```
Using smart defaults:
- Mode: YOLO (auto-approve, just execute)
- Auto-advance: Enabled (phases chain automatically)
- TDD: Governed by project kind/work defaults
- Parallelization: Enabled
- Git tracking: Yes

Run `/devflow:settings` anytime to customize.
```

**Check for `--interactive` flag:** If present, skip the question below and expand the full question flow directly.

Otherwise use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Settings"
- question: "Use these defaults, or customize them?"
- options:
  - "Use defaults (Recommended)" — Continue with the defaults above
  - "Customize" — Answer the full set of settings questions

**If "Use defaults (Recommended)":** Use the defaults; skip the question flow below.

**If `--interactive` flag OR "Customize":**

Use AskUserQuestion:

```
questions: [
  {
    header: "Depth",
    question: "How thorough should planning be?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Quick (Recommended)", description: "Ship fast (3-5 objectives, 1-3 TRDs each)" },
      { label: "Standard", description: "Balanced scope and speed (5-8 objectives, 3-5 TRDs each)" },
      { label: "Comprehensive", description: "Thorough coverage (8-12 objectives, 5-10 TRDs each)" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "AI Models",
    question: "Which AI models for planning agents?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Balanced (Recommended)", description: "Sonnet for most agents — good quality/cost ratio" },
      { label: "Quality", description: "Opus for research/roadmap — higher cost, deeper analysis" },
      { label: "Budget", description: "Haiku where possible — fastest, lowest cost" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Git Tracking",
    question: "Commit planning docs to git?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Planning docs tracked in version control" },
      { label: "No", description: "Keep .planning/ local-only (add to .gitignore)" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Research",
    question: "Research the domain ecosystem before defining requirements?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Research first (Recommended)", description: "Discover standard stacks, expected features, architecture patterns" },
      { label: "Skip research", description: "I know this domain well, go straight to requirements" }
    ]
  }
]
```

Record the Research answer (question 4) — use it in Step 6 to skip the standalone ask.

Create `.planning/config.json` with settings (defaults + any overrides):

```json
{
  "mode": "yolo",
  "depth": "quick|standard|comprehensive",
  "parallelization": true,
  "commit_docs": true|false,
  "model_profile": "quality|balanced|budget",
  "workflow": {
    "research": true,
    "job_check": true,
    "verifier": true,
    "auto_advance": true
  }
}
```

**If commit_docs = No:**
- Set `commit_docs: false` in config.json
- Add `.planning/` to `.gitignore` (create if needed)

**If commit_docs = Yes:**
- No additional gitignore entries needed

**Commit config.json:**

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs commit "chore: add project config" --files .planning/config.json
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs upgrade --register
```

Registers this repo for backup pruning; ignore an unknown-flag error from an older mirror.

**Note:** Run `/devflow:settings` anytime to update these preferences.

## 5.5. Resolve Model Profile

Use models from init: `researcher_model`, `synthesizer_model`, `roadmapper_model`.

## 6. Research Decision

**If auto mode:** Default to "Research first" without asking.

**If interactive path (Step 5 batch):** Research answer was already collected as question 4 in Step 5 — use that answer directly, skip the standalone AskUserQuestion below. (Content-independent, so batched above.)

**Otherwise (defaults path — no --interactive flag):** Use smart default "Research first" without asking.

**If --interactive flag was NOT present AND user was NOT asked in Step 5:** Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Research"
- question: "Research the domain ecosystem before defining requirements?"
- options:
  - "Research first (Recommended)" — Discover standard stacks, expected features, architecture patterns
  - "Skip research" — I know this domain well, go straight to requirements

**If "Research first":**

Display stage banner:

Create research directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .planning/research

**Determine milestone context:**

Check if this is greenfield or subsequent milestone:
- If no "Validated" requirements in PROJECT.md → Greenfield (building from scratch)
- If "Validated" requirements exist → Subsequent milestone (adding to existing app)

After all 4 agents complete:

**Update progress (if available):** Mark all 4 research tasks as completed:
```
TaskUpdate(taskId=stack_task_id, status="completed")
TaskUpdate(taskId=features_task_id, status="completed")
TaskUpdate(taskId=architecture_task_id, status="completed")
TaskUpdate(taskId=pitfalls_task_id, status="completed")
```

**Progress tracking (if available):**
```
TaskCreate(subject="Synthesize research", description="Combining 4 research outputs into SUMMARY.md", activeForm="Synthesizing research")
```

**Model optimization for synthesizer:**

Calculate total research output size. If all 4 research files combined are < 3000 words: use haiku for synthesis (simple aggregation task). Otherwise: use `synthesizer_model` from profile. Log override if applied: `Model override: research-synthesizer {synthesizer_model} → haiku (reason: small research output)`

Spawn synthesizer to compose SUMMARY.md. It returns the content as text — the harness blocks
subagent report files, so the orchestrator (you) writes and commits it:

```
Task(prompt="
<task>
Synthesize research outputs into SUMMARY.md.
</task>

<research_files>
Read these files:
- .planning/research/STACK.md
- .planning/research/FEATURES.md

</research_files>

<output>
Use template: ~/.claude/devflow/templates/research-project/SUMMARY.md
Return the SUMMARY.md content between the BEGIN/END markers. Do not write files.
</output>
", subagent_type="research-synthesizer", model="{synthesizer_model}", description="Synthesize research")
```

**Publish and commit SUMMARY.md (orchestrator):**

a. **Extract** the text strictly between the `--- BEGIN SUMMARY.md ---` and
   `--- END SUMMARY.md ---` lines of the synthesizer's final message (markers excluded).
   *Fallback — markers missing:* take the whole final message minus a leading
   `## SYNTHESIS COMPLETE` header block (the header line and the file list / `**Output:**` lines
   that follow it, up to the first line of the summary body).
   If the message is `## SYNTHESIS BLOCKED`, surface the blocker instead of writing anything.
b. **Publish** it verbatim. Run `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs planning draft research/SUMMARY.md`,
   put the extracted text at the printed path with the Write tool, then run
   `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs doc put research/SUMMARY.md --from "$DRAFT"`.
   Do not summarise, reword or reformat it: local mode stores exactly those bytes in
   `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md`; store mode publishes the research wiki page.
c. **Commit** all research in one commit. The researchers published their four files without
   committing, so this single commit covers all 5 files:
   ```bash
   node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs commit "docs: complete project research" --files .planning/research/
   ```

**Update progress (if available):**

```

 DF ► RESEARCH COMPLETE ✓
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Key Findings

**Stack:** [from SUMMARY.md]
**Table Stakes:** [from SUMMARY.md]
**Watch Out For:** [from SUMMARY.md]

Files: `.planning/research/`
```

**Draft the stack profile:**

Skip this step if `.planning/STACK.md` already exists.

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs stack init --from research --raw
```

If the command fails with "Unknown command" (an older DevFlow mirror), skip this step silently.
Otherwise show the draft, then use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Stack"
- question: "Write this draft as .planning/STACK.md?"
- options:
  - "Write it (Recommended)" — Write the draft as shown
  - "Edit first" — Tell me what to change, then show the draft again
  - "Skip" — Do not write a stack profile now

Only on **"Write it"** run `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs stack init --from research --write`.
On "Edit first", apply the user's changes and ask again. On "Skip", continue without writing it.
STACK.md is prescriptive; research/STACK.md stays descriptive and is its evidence. Never write it without confirmation.

**If "Skip research":** Continue to Step 7.

## 7. Define Requirements

Display stage banner:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 DF ► DEFINING REQUIREMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Load context:**

Read PROJECT.md and extract:
- Core value (the ONE thing that must work)
- Stated constraints (budget, timeline, tech limitations)
- Any explicit scope boundaries

**If research exists:** Read research/FEATURES.md and extract feature categories.

**If auto mode:**
- Auto-include all table stakes features (users expect these)
- Include features explicitly mentioned in provided document
- Auto-defer differentiators not mentioned in document
- Skip per-category AskUserQuestion loops
- Skip "Any additions?" question
- Skip requirements approval gate
- Generate REQUIREMENTS.md and commit directly

**Present features by category (interactive mode only):**

```
Here are the features for [domain]:

## Authentication
**Table stakes:**
- Sign up with email/password
- Email verification
- Password reset
- Session management

**Differentiators:**
- Magic link login
- OAuth (Google, GitHub)
- 2FA

**Research notes:** [any relevant notes]

---

## [Next Category]
...
```

**If no research:** Gather requirements through conversation instead.

<!-- builtin-audit: allow free-text: the answer is an open list of capabilities, not a choice -->
Ask: "What are the main things users need to be able to do?"

For each capability mentioned:
- Ask clarifying questions to make it specific
- Probe for related capabilities
- Group into categories

**Scope each category:**

<!-- Sequential by design: each question asks about a different category discovered from prior answers. Content-dependent — cannot batch. -->

For each category, use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "[Category]" (max 12 chars)
- question: "Which [category] features are in v1?"
- multiSelect: true
- options:
  - "[Feature 1]" — [brief description]
  - "[Feature 2]" — [brief description]
  - "[Feature 3]" — [brief description]
  - "None for v1" — Defer entire category

Track responses:
- Selected features → v1 requirements
- Unselected table stakes → v2 (users expect these)
- Unselected differentiators → out of scope

**Identify gaps:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Additions"
- question: "Any requirements research missed? (Features specific to your vision)"
- options:
  - "No, research covered it" — Proceed
  - "Yes, let me add some" — Capture additions

**Validate core value:**

Cross-check requirements against Core Value from PROJECT.md. If gaps detected, surface them.

**Generate REQUIREMENTS.md:**

Draft REQUIREMENTS.md (path from `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs planning draft REQUIREMENTS.md`) with:
- v1 Requirements grouped by category (checkboxes, REQ-IDs)
- v2 Requirements (deferred)
- Out of Scope (explicit exclusions with reasoning)
- Traceability section (empty, filled by roadmap)

**REQ-ID format:** `[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (AUTH-01, CONTENT-02)

**Requirement quality criteria:**

Good requirements are:
- **Specific and testable:** "User can reset password via email link" (not "Handle password reset")
- **User-centric:** "User can X" (not "System does Y")
- **Atomic:** One capability per requirement (not "User can login and manage profile")
- **Independent:** Minimal dependencies on other requirements

Reject vague requirements. Push for specificity:
- "Handle authentication" → "User can log in with email/password and stay logged in across sessions"
- "Support sharing" → "User can share post via link that opens in recipient's browser"

**Review the requirements draft (plan mode, interactive mode only):**

**Skip if:** `--auto` (auto mode approves the draft, as before). new-project does not key on
`workflow.auto_advance`: it writes that key as true for every project (references/built-ins.md).

EnterPlanMode()

Put in the plan: every requirement of the draft (not counts), in this shape, then "On approval: publish with
`doc put REQUIREMENTS.md` and commit":

```
## v1 Requirements

### Authentication
- [ ] **AUTH-01**: User can create account with email/password
- [ ] **AUTH-02**: User can log in and stay logged in across sessions
- [ ] **AUTH-03**: User can log out from any page

### Content
- [ ] **CONT-01**: User can create posts with text
- [ ] **CONT-02**: User can edit their own posts

[... full list ...]
```

ExitPlanMode()

Approved → apply any edits the user made to the draft in the plan, then publish. "No, keep planning" → add
`## Requested changes`, ExitPlanMode again; on approval return to scoping with the changes (the same path "adjust"
took), update the draft and present it again.

**Commit requirements (after approval or auto mode):**

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs doc put REQUIREMENTS.md --from "$DRAFT"
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs commit "docs: define v1 requirements" --files .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
```

## 8. Create Roadmap

Display stage banner:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 DF ► CREATING ROADMAP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

◆ Spawning roadmapper...
```

**Progress tracking (if available):**
```
TaskCreate(subject="Create roadmap", description="Deriving objectives from requirements, mapping coverage, defining success criteria", activeForm="Creating roadmap")
```

Spawn roadmapper agent with context:

```
Task(prompt="
<planning_context>

**Project:**
@.planning/PROJECT.md

**Requirements:**
@.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md

**Research (if exists):**
@.planning/research/SUMMARY.md

**Config:**
@.planning/config.json

</planning_context>

<instructions>
Create roadmap:
1. Derive objectives from requirements (don't impose structure)
2. Map every v1 requirement to exactly one objective
3. Derive 2-5 success criteria per objective (observable user behaviors)
4. Validate 100% coverage
5. Persist immediately, per your Step 7: run `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs planning mode`; `local` → write ROADMAP.md and STATE.md as today; `store` → `objective add` + `objective put` per objective, then `gh pull --all`; both → publish the REQUIREMENTS.md traceability with `doc put REQUIREMENTS.md`
6. Return ROADMAP CREATED with summary

Persist first, then return. This ensures artifacts persist even if context is lost.
</instructions>
", subagent_type="roadmapper", model="{roadmapper_model}", description="Create roadmap")
```

**Update progress (if available):**
```
TaskUpdate(taskId=roadmap_task_id, status="completed")
```

**Handle roadmapper return:**

**If `## ROADMAP BLOCKED`:**
- Present blocker information
- Work with user to resolve
- Re-spawn when resolved

**If `## ROADMAP CREATED`:**

Read the created ROADMAP.md and build the proposed roadmap from it, in this shape. Interactive mode puts it in the
plan below; auto mode needs no review:

```
---

## Proposed Roadmap

**[N] objectives** | **[X] requirements mapped** | All v1 requirements covered ✓

| # | Objective | Goal | Requirements | Success Criteria |
|---|-------|------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | [Name] | [Goal] | [REQ-IDs] | [count] |
| 2 | [Name] | [Goal] | [REQ-IDs] | [count] |

...

### Objective Details

**Objective 1: [Name]**
Goal: [goal]
Requirements: [REQ-IDs]
Success criteria:
1. [criterion]
2. [criterion]
3. [criterion]

**Objective 2: [Name]**
Goal: [goal]
Requirements: [REQ-IDs]
Success criteria:
1. [criterion]
2. [criterion]

[... continue for all objectives ...]

---
```

**If auto mode:** Skip approval gate — auto-approve and commit directly.

**CRITICAL: Review the roadmap before committing (plan mode, interactive mode only):**

**Skip if:** `--auto` (auto mode approves the roadmap, as before). new-project does not key on
`workflow.auto_advance`: it writes that key as true for every project (references/built-ins.md).

EnterPlanMode()

Put in the plan: the Proposed Roadmap above (the summary table and every objective's details) with the path
`.planning/ROADMAP.md` for the full file, then "On approval: commit ROADMAP.md, STATE.md and REQUIREMENTS.md". The
roadmapper has already persisted the roadmap draft; nothing is committed until approval.

ExitPlanMode()

**If approved:** Continue to commit.

**If "No, keep planning":** add `## Requested changes` to the plan stating the user's notes concretely, and
ExitPlanMode again. On approval, re-spawn the roadmapper with the revision context:
  ```
  Task(prompt="
  <revision>
  User feedback on roadmap:
  [the Requested changes]

  Current ROADMAP.md: @.planning/ROADMAP.md

  Update the roadmap based on feedback. Edit files in place.
  Return ROADMAP REVISED with changes made.
  </revision>
  ", subagent_type="roadmapper", model="{roadmapper_model}", description="Revise roadmap")
  ```
Then put the revised roadmap draft in the plan and review it again. Loop until the user approves.

**Commit roadmap (after approval or auto mode):**

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs commit "docs: create roadmap ([N] objectives)" --files .planning/ROADMAP.md .planning/STATE.md .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
```

## 8.5. GitHub Sync (optional)

If `.planning/config.json` has `github.enabled: true` and `github.repo` set, sync the roadmap to GitHub issues:

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs gh sync --all
```

This reports `skipped` and exits 0 when GitHub integration is disabled. When it is enabled and `gh` is not authenticated it exits 1 with the fix. The command:
- Uses each objective's `milestone:` (else the ROADMAP `## Milestones` current entry)
- Creates one issue per objective with goal + success criteria, and records its number as `github_issue` in each OBJECTIVE.md
- Persists issue numbers in `.planning/.gh-mapping.json` (commit this file)
- Is idempotent — re-running updates existing issues and never duplicates them

If issues were created, commit the mapping file and the OBJECTIVE.md files that gained `github_issue`:

```bash
[ -f .planning/.gh-mapping.json ] && node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs commit "chore: sync objectives to GitHub" --files .planning/.gh-mapping.json $(git ls-files -m -o --exclude-standard -- '.planning/objectives/*/OBJECTIVE.md')
```

The `git ls-files` list holds only OBJECTIVE.md files that changed, so a roadmap with no objective directories yet does not pass `commit` a glob that matches nothing (git rejects it).
