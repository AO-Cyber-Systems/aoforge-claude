<purpose>
Execute all jobs in an objective using wave-based parallel execution. Orchestrator stays lean — delegates job execution to subagents.
</purpose>

<core_principle>
Orchestrator coordinates, not executes. Each subagent loads the full execute-trd context. Orchestrator: discover plans → analyze deps → group waves → spawn agents → handle checkpoints → collect results.
</core_principle>

<required_reading>
Read STATE.md before any operation to load project context.

<process>

<step name="initialize" priority="first">
Load all context in one call:

```bash
INIT=$(node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs init execute-objective "${OBJECTIVE_ARG}")
```

Parse JSON for: `executor_model`, `verifier_model`, `commit_docs`, `parallelization`, `branching_strategy`, `branch_name`, `objective_found`, `objective_dir`, `objective_number`, `objective_name`, `objective_slug`, `jobs`, `incomplete_jobs`, `job_count`, `incomplete_count`, `state_exists`, `roadmap_exists`, `bootstrap`, `bootstrap_objectives`.

**Bootstrap surface (one line, only when something changed).** If `bootstrap.applied` is true or
`bootstrap_objectives.applied > 0`, print exactly one line and continue:
`DevFlow bootstrap: PROJECT.md +<bootstrap.added_fields joined by ,> · created <bootstrap_objectives.paths joined by , > (uncommitted — folded into the next docs commit)`
Omit whichever half did not apply. Print nothing when neither applied.

**If `objective_found` is false:** Error — objective directory not found.
**If `job_count` is 0:** Error — no plans found in objective.
**If `state_exists` is false but `.planning/` exists:** Offer reconstruct or continue.

When `parallelization` is false, plans within a wave execute sequentially.
</step>

<step name="handle_branching">
Check `branching_strategy` from init:

All subsequent commits go to this branch. User handles merging.

If `GAPS_ONLY` is true, skip this step entirely and proceed to `discover_and_group_plans`.

Otherwise, run execute-time duplicate-work detection. Per CONTEXT.md locked decision #5 (friction-minimal at execute-time): only blocking matches trigger a prompt. Advisory matches are filtered upstream by `detectDuplicates(mode='execute')` and are never surfaced here. No-match path is a silent JSONL log entry.

**If `DETECT_WARNINGS_LEN > 0`**, display warnings as informational blockquote (do NOT block execution):

**If `DETECT_BLOCKING == "false"`** (no blocking match — the friction-minimal path):

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs dup-detect log "${OBJECTIVE_ARG}" \
  --mode execute --blocking false --resolution none 2>/dev/null || true

Continue silently to `discover_and_group_plans`. **Do not display anything to the user.** This is the common case.

```

Then surface AskUserQuestion (same 4-option list as plan-time, per CONTEXT.md locked decision #3):

```
AskUserQuestion(

    multiSelect: false

Map the user's label to a resolution string:

```bash

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Overlapping work found on peer branch. Switch to the peer session and continue there:
    git checkout {PEER_BRANCH}

  Current objective directory left intact for manual cleanup.
  ```

  Run no further steps.

- **defer** → Display deferred state file path. EXIT the workflow before `discover_and_group_plans`. Executor agents are NOT spawned. Display:

  ```
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   DF ► EXECUTION DEFERRED

  Objective state persisted to: {RESOLVE_RESULT.defer_path}

  Run no further steps.

- **coordinate** OR **proceed-anyway** → Coordination Note has been appended to CONTEXT.md by `df-tools dup-detect resolve`. Continue to `discover_and_group_plans`. Executor agents will read CONTEXT.md transitively via their job context.

**Error recovery:** If `df-tools dup-detect resolve` exits non-zero, display the error and ask: "Continue without recording (Y) or retry (R)?" Recommended fallback: log via `dup-detect log` directly + continue to `discover_and_group_plans`.

```
</step>

<step name="execute_waves">
Execute each wave in sequence. Within a wave: parallel if `PARALLELIZATION=true`, sequential if `false`.

**For each wave:**

0. **Fix the repo and the base for this wave (BEFORE spawning) — issue #86:**

   An executor must be told which repository it is working in and which commit its work
   builds on. Neither may be left to the harness to infer: it used to resolve the repo
   from *this* session's cwd (dispatching an aodex objective from a session rooted
   elsewhere put the executor in a different repository entirely) and the base from the
   default branch (so wave 2 started without wave 1's commits).

   Read both, here, at the start of every wave — not once at the start of the objective.
   `WAVE_BASE` must be re-read per wave; that is what makes wave N+1 see wave N:

   ```bash
   git rev-parse --show-toplevel
   ```
   ```bash
   git rev-parse HEAD
   ```

   Note the two values down as literals (`REPO_ROOT`, `WAVE_BASE`) — a shell variable does
   not survive into the next Bash call. Both go into every executor prompt in this wave.

   **Sequential wave (`PARALLELIZATION=false`, or a single plan):** the executor runs in
   `REPO_ROOT` itself, on the branch already checked out. `WAVE_BASE` is the current HEAD,
   so the previous wave's commits are present by construction, and its preflight proves it.

   **Parallel wave (2+ plans):** give each plan its own worktree, provisioned explicitly
   from `WAVE_BASE` in the target repo — never from the default branch:

   ```bash
   node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs exec-context worktree --repo <REPO_ROOT> --id <plan_id> --base <WAVE_BASE>
   ```

   Run one per plan. Each prints `worktree_path`, `branch`, `merge_back` and `remove`;
   note them down. Pass `worktree_path` as that executor's working directory, and merge
   the branches back in step 5b before the next wave reads `WAVE_BASE` again.

1. **Describe what's being built (BEFORE spawning):**

   Read each job's `<objective>`. Extract what's being built and why.

   ```
   ---
   ## Wave {N}

   **{Plan ID}: {Plan Name}**
   {2-3 sentences: what this builds, technical approach, why it matters}

   Spawning {count} agent(s)...
   ---
   ```

   - Bad: "Executing terrain generation plan"
   - Good: "Procedural terrain generator using Perlin noise — creates height maps, biome zones, and collision meshes. Required before vehicle physics can interact with ground."

2. **Create progress tasks (if available):**

   For each job in the wave:
   ```
   TaskCreate(
     subject="Execute {plan_id}: {plan_name}",
     description="Executing plan {plan_number}: {plan_objective}",
     activeForm="Executing {plan_id}"
   )
   ```

3. **Assess plan complexity for model selection:**

   For each job in the wave, evaluate complexity:
   - Read `task_count` and `files_modified` from plan index
   - **Simple** (task_count <= 2, files_modified <= 3): use sonnet — straightforward implementation
   - **Standard** (task_count 3-5): use `executor_model` from profile — normal execution
   - **Complex** (task_count > 5 or files_modified > 8): use opus — benefits from stronger context management

   Log any overrides: `Model override: executor {executor_model} → {override} for {plan_id} (reason: {simple|complex} plan)`

   Safety rule: never downgrade executor below sonnet.

4. **Spawn executor agents:**

   Embed the full TRD content inline in every executor spawn prompt. A parallel-wave
   executor runs in the worktree you provisioned in step 0, where uncommitted .planning/
   files from the parent tree are not visible. Embedding the TRD guarantees the executor
   has its plan regardless of worktree state. Context cost: ~plan size per spawn;
   acceptable because TRDs are 2-3 tasks.

   Before spawning, read the plan file into orchestrator context:
   ```
   TRD_CONTENT = Read("{objective_dir}/{plan_file}")
   ```

   ```
   Task(
     subagent_type="executor",
     model="{resolved_executor_model}",
     prompt="
       <objective>
       Execute plan {plan_number} of objective {objective_number}-{objective_name}.
       Commit each task atomically. Create SUMMARY.md. Update STATE.md and ROADMAP.md.
       </objective>

       <execution_context>
       @~/.claude/devflow/workflows/execute-trd.md
       @~/.claude/devflow/templates/summary.md
       @~/.claude/devflow/references/checkpoints.md
       @~/.claude/devflow/references/tdd.md
       @~/.claude/devflow/references/anti-patterns.md
       </execution_context>

       <plan_content>
       The full TRD content is embedded below because you may be running in an isolated
       worktree where .planning/ files from the parent tree are not visible.
       --- BEGIN TRD ---
       {TRD_CONTENT}
       --- END TRD ---
       </plan_content>

       <repo_and_base>
       REPO_ROOT:  {REPO_ROOT}
       WAVE_BASE:  {WAVE_BASE}
       PLAN_ID:    {plan_id}

       Before anything else, prove you are where you are supposed to be:

         node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs exec-context check --repo {REPO_ROOT} --base {WAVE_BASE} --id {plan_id}

       Exit 1 means WRONG REPOSITORY, BASE NOT VISIBLE or SHARED INDEX — all are hard stops. Report
       which fired, quote the output, and end your turn without writing anything. Do not
       try the paths anyway: a wrong-repo spawn cannot land a single commit where it is
       being looked for, and it fails silently if you let it.
       </repo_and_base>

       <worktree_protocol>
       - You may be in a git worktree the orchestrator provisioned for you. Commit to your
         current branch as normal.
       - Write SUMMARY.md at the path given in the TRD output section and COMMIT it —
         the orchestrator reads it from your branch after merging.
       - STATE.md/ROADMAP.md updates: include them in your commits; conflicts are resolved
         at merge time by the orchestrator.
       </worktree_protocol>

       <success_criteria>
       - [ ] All tasks executed
       - [ ] Each task committed individually
       - [ ] SUMMARY.md created in plan directory and committed
       - [ ] STATE.md updated with position and decisions
       - [ ] ROADMAP.md updated with job progress (via `roadmap update-job-progress`)
       </success_criteria>
     "
   )
   ```

5. **Wait for all agents in wave to complete.**

   **Background execution (when `PARALLELIZATION=true` AND wave has 2+ plans):**

   Spawn each executor with `run_in_background=true` to enable true parallel execution:
   ```
   task_ids = []
   for each job in wave:
     result = Task(
       subagent_type="executor",
       model="{resolved_executor_model}",
       prompt="...",
       run_in_background=true
     )
     task_ids.append(result.task_id)
   ```

   While waiting for background agents:
   - Pre-read next wave's plan objectives (if next wave exists) to prepare context
   - Update TaskList progress periodically

   Poll for completion:
   ```
   for each task_id in task_ids:
     result = TaskOutput(task_id=task_id, block=true, timeout=600000)
   ```

   Collect all results, then proceed to step 5b.

   **Sequential execution (when `PARALLELIZATION=false` OR wave has 1 plan):**

   Use standard blocking Task() calls (existing behavior).

5b. **Merge the wave's worktree branches (parallel waves only):**

   A sequential wave has nothing to merge — the executor committed to the branch you are
   already on, which is why `WAVE_BASE` for the next wave is simply the new HEAD.

   For a parallel wave, you provisioned each worktree yourself in step 0 and noted its
   `branch` and `merge_back` command, so there is no branch-list diffing to do — you know
   the names. Merge every one back into the current branch BEFORE any disk-based
   spot-check: file-existence checks read the working tree, so merge-before-spot-check
   ordering is mandatory.

   Prior art: workstreams.cjs provisions worktrees the same way, with `worktree_prefix`
   and `merge_strategy: "squash"`.

   **Branch merge protocol** — one plain command per call, for each plan in the wave:
   ```bash
   git merge --no-ff df/exec-{plan_id}
   ```
   File ownership is exclusive per wave (each TRD owns different files), so a conflict
   indicates a planning error. On conflict:
   ```bash
   git merge --abort
   ```
   Route to the failure handler with: "Merge conflict on {branch} — planning error, two
   TRDs in the same wave modified the same file."

   Then remove each worktree (the `remove` command `exec-context worktree` printed):
   ```bash
   git worktree remove <worktree_path>
   ```

   **Why the base is stated rather than inferred (issue #86):** platform-managed isolation
   branched from the default branch, not the parent HEAD, so on a feature branch the prior
   waves' commits were simply missing from a fresh worktree — each wave silently re-did or
   contradicted the last. Provisioning from `WAVE_BASE` and merging back here is what makes
   wave N+1 see wave N. The executor's `exec-context check --base` proves it rather than
   trusting it. `--id` makes check refuse a second parallel TRD in the same checkout, so
   skipping `exec-context worktree` for a parallel wave now fails loudly with `SHARED INDEX`
   (#98); a dead executor's claim is cleared with `exec-context release`.

   After all branches are merged, `git log --all --grep` and the file-existence spot-checks
   in step 6 will see every wave commit.

6. **Report completion — spot-check claims first:**

   **Update progress (if available):** For each completed plan:
   ```
   TaskUpdate(taskId=plan_task_id, status="completed")
   ```

   For each SUMMARY.md:
   - Verify first 2 files from `key-files.created` exist on disk
   - Check `git log --oneline --all --grep="{objective}-{job}"` returns ≥1 commit
   - Check for `## Self-Check: FAILED` marker

   If ANY spot-check fails: report which plan failed, route to failure handler. If `MODE` is `"autonomous"`, apply the autonomous failure protocol in step 7 directly (do not prompt). Otherwise ask "Retry plan?" or "Continue with remaining waves?"

   If pass:
   ```
   ---
   ## Wave {N} Complete

   **{Plan ID}: {Plan Name}**
   {What was built — from SUMMARY.md}
   {Notable deviations, if any}

   {If more waves: what this enables for next wave}
   ---
   ```

   - Bad: "Wave 2 complete. Proceeding to Wave 3."
   - Good: "Terrain system complete — 3 biome types, height-based texturing, physics collision meshes. Vehicle physics (Wave 3) can now reference ground surfaces."

7. **Handle failures:**

   **Known Claude Code bug (classifyHandoffIfNeeded):** If an agent reports "failed" with error containing `classifyHandoffIfNeeded is not defined`, this is a Claude Code runtime bug — not a DevFlow or agent issue. The error fires in the completion handler AFTER all tool calls finish. In this case: run the same spot-checks as step 4 (SUMMARY.md exists, git commits present, no Self-Check: FAILED). If spot-checks PASS → treat as **successful**. If spot-checks FAIL → treat as real failure below.

   **Autonomous failure protocol (when `MODE` is `"autonomous"`):**

   1. **RETRY ONCE:** Re-spawn a fresh executor for the failed plan with a `<failure_feedback>` block appended to the standard executor prompt:
      ```
      <failure_feedback>
      The previous attempt at this plan failed. Do NOT repeat the same approach.
      Spot-check results: {which files were missing, which commits were absent, any Self-Check: FAILED markers}
      Error output from failed attempt: {agent error / last output}
      Partial commits from failed attempt (if any): {git log output for this plan's commits}
      </failure_feedback>
      ```

   2. **If the retry also fails:** Compute the dependent set — all TRDs whose `depends_on` transitively includes the failed plan id. The orchestrator already holds this data from the objective-job-index wave/depends_on map; no shell-out needed. Skipped TRD entries are recorded with the blocking failure id.

   3. **SKIP only the dependent set.** Continue executing all remaining independent TRDs in subsequent waves as normal.

   4. **Final report** — include in `aggregate_results` output:

      | Status | TRD | Detail |
      |--------|-----|--------|
      | ✓ Complete | {id} | {one-liner from SUMMARY.md} |
      | ✗ Failed | {id} | {last error summary} |
      | ⏭ Skipped | {id} | blocked by {failed-plan-id} |
      | ⏸ Parked | {id} | pending DECISION-NNN |

      Never ask "Continue?/Stop?" mid-run in autonomous mode.

   **Non-autonomous failure handling (when `MODE` is NOT `"autonomous"`):**

   For real failures: report which plan failed → ask "Continue?" or "Stop?" → if continue, dependent plans may also fail. If stop, partial completion report.

8. **Execute checkpoint plans between waves** — see `<checkpoint_handling>`.

9. **Proceed to next wave.**
</step>

<step name="checkpoint_handling">
Plans with `autonomous: false` require user interaction.

**Mode-aware checkpoint handling:**

Read mode and auto-advance config:
```bash
MODE=$(node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs config-get mode 2>/dev/null || echo "yolo")
AUTO_CFG=$(node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs config-get workflow.auto_advance 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
```

**Branch 1 — Autonomous mode (`MODE` is `"autonomous"`):**

When executor returns a checkpoint AND `MODE` is `"autonomous"`:

- **human-verify** → VERIFIER-DELEGATED. Do NOT blind-approve. Spawn the verifier agent in checkpoint verification mode with the checkpoint's `what-built`, `how-to-verify` steps, and plan ID. Pass the port constraint in the prompt.

  ```
  Task(
    subagent_type="verifier",
    model="{resolved_verifier_model}",
    prompt="
      <objective>
      CHECKPOINT VERIFICATION MODE — scoped functional pass, not full objective verification.
      Verify the checkpoint below and return structured status.
      </objective>

      <checkpoint_context>
      Plan: {plan_id} — {plan_name}
      What was built: {what-built from checkpoint}
      How to verify: {how-to-verify steps from checkpoint}
      </checkpoint_context>

      <constraints>
      - NEVER use port 8080 for anything. It is permanently occupied on the operator's machine.
        If a dev/verification server is needed, bind port 8091 instead.
      - Run only the checks needed to prove or disprove the how-to-verify steps.
        Do not re-verify the whole objective.
      </constraints>

      <output_format>
      Return structured status:
        status: passed | gaps_found | human_needed
      Include evidence: commands run, observed output, screenshots taken.
      </output_format>
    "
  )
  ```

  **On verifier return:**

  - `status: passed` → spawn continuation agent with `{user_response}` = `"approved (verifier evidence: {one-line summary})"`. Log `⚡ Verifier-approved: [checkpoint]`.
  - `status: gaps_found` OR `status: human_needed` → escalate to user. Present the checkpoint using the standard "Present to user" format (step 4 of standard flow below) PLUS append a `### Verifier Report` section with the verifier's full evidence output. Wait for user response before spawning continuation agent.
  - Verifier timeout or ambiguous return → treat as `human_needed` and escalate to user. Never approve on ambiguity.

- **decision** → PARK, NOTIFY, CONTINUE INDEPENDENT.

  1. **Park:** Run the decision-queue add command with full context:
     ```bash
     node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs decision-queue add \
       --objective {N} --trd {plan_id} --wave {W} \
       --title "{one-line decision summary from checkpoint}" \
       --context "{context block from checkpoint return}" \
       --options "{option ids, comma-separated — e.g., option-a,option-b}" \
       --recommendation "{executor's recommended option id}" \
       --blocks "{TRD ids in the blocked set}" \
       --independent "{remaining executable TRD ids}"
     ```

     **Computing `--blocks` and `--independent`:**
     - The orchestrator already holds all wave/depends_on data loaded from objective-job-index.
     - Blocked set = TRDs whose `decision_gate` frontmatter matches this decision's id (DECISION-NNN), PLUS their transitive `depends_on` closure, PLUS the parked plan itself (whose continuation requires the answer).
     - When no TRD declares a `decision_gate` for this decision, `--blocks` is the parked plan id only; everything else is independent.
     - `df-tools decision-queue add` fires the OS notification itself — no separate notify call needed.

  2. **Mark parked:** Update the wave table entry for the parked plan to status `⏸ parked on DECISION-NNN`.

  3. **Continue independent:** Proceed to the next wave executing every TRD not in the blocked set. Do NOT halt all waves. Do NOT auto-select any option — parking is the only autonomous handling for decisions.

  4. **Aggregate report:** The `aggregate_results` step includes a `### Pending Decisions` section (see that step).

- **Rule 4 deviation return (autonomous mode):** When an executor returns a Rule 4 architectural stop (not a checkpoint task, but an agent return containing `decision:`, `options:`, `recommendation:` fields) AND `MODE` is `"autonomous"`:
  Park it identically to `checkpoint:decision` using `decision-queue add` with `type: rule-4-deviation`. The executor's `recommendation:` field maps to `--recommendation`, the `options:` list maps to `--options`, and the `context:` field maps to `--context`. Blocked set computation is the same as above. Never surface Rule 4 stops as mid-run user prompts in autonomous mode.

- **human-action** → Present to user. Auth gates cannot be automated.

**Branch 2 — Legacy yolo (`MODE` is NOT `"autonomous"` AND `AUTO_CFG` is `"true"`):**

When executor returns a checkpoint AND `MODE` is not `"autonomous"` AND `AUTO_CFG` is `"true"`:
- **human-verify** → Auto-spawn continuation agent with `{user_response}` = `"approved"`. Log `⚡ Auto-approved checkpoint`.
- **decision** → Auto-spawn continuation agent with `{user_response}` = first option from checkpoint details. Log `⚡ Auto-selected: [option]`.
- **human-action** → Present to user (existing behavior below). Auth gates cannot be automated.

**Branch 3 — Standard interactive flow (not auto-mode, or human-action type):**

1. Spawn agent for checkpoint plan
2. Agent runs until checkpoint task or auth gate → returns structured state
3. Agent return includes: completed tasks table, current task + blocker, checkpoint type/details, what's awaited
4. **Present to user:**
   ```
   ## Checkpoint: [Type]

   **Plan:** 03-03 Dashboard Layout
   **Progress:** 2/3 tasks complete

   [Checkpoint Details from agent return]
   [Awaiting section from agent return]
   ```
5. User responds: "approved"/"done" | issue description | decision selection
6. **Spawn continuation agent (NOT resume)** using continuation-prompt.md template:
   - `{completed_tasks_table}`: From checkpoint return
   - `{resume_task_number}` + `{resume_task_name}`: Current task
   - `{user_response}`: What user provided
   - `{resume_instructions}`: Based on checkpoint type
7. Continuation agent verifies previous commits, continues from resume point
8. Repeat until plan completes or user stops

**Why fresh agent, not resume:** Resume relies on internal serialization that breaks with parallel tool calls. Fresh agents with explicit state are more reliable.

**Future consideration:** For simple plans (single auto task + checkpoint, no parallel tool calls), agent resume may be viable. Before considering resume, verify the agent did NOT use parallel tool calls during execution. See `@~/.claude/devflow/references/checkpoints.md` "Resume vs Fresh Agent Decision" section for the full decision framework.

**Checkpoints in parallel waves:** Agent pauses and returns while other parallel agents may complete. Present checkpoint, spawn continuation, wait for all before next wave.

<step name="close_parent_artifacts">
**For decimal/polish objectives only (X.Y pattern):** Close the feedback loop by resolving parent UAT and debug artifacts.

**Skip if** objective number has no decimal (e.g., `3`, `04`) — only applies to gap-closure objectives like `4.1`, `03.1`.

**1. Detect decimal objective and derive parent:**
```bash
# Check if objective_number contains a decimal
if [[ "$OBJECTIVE_NUMBER" == *.* ]]; then
  PARENT_OBJECTIVE="${OBJECTIVE_NUMBER%%.*}"
fi
```

**2. Find parent UAT file:**
```bash
PARENT_INFO=$(node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs find-objective "${PARENT_OBJECTIVE}" --raw)
# Extract directory from PARENT_INFO JSON, then find UAT file in that directory
```

**If no parent UAT found:** Skip this step (gap-closure may have been triggered by VERIFICATION.md instead).

**3. Update UAT gap statuses:**

Read the parent UAT file's `## Gaps` section. For each gap entry with `status: failed`:
- Update to `status: resolved`

**4. Update UAT frontmatter:**

If all gaps now have `status: resolved`:
- Update frontmatter `status: diagnosed` → `status: resolved`
- Update frontmatter `updated:` timestamp

**5. Resolve referenced debug sessions:**

For each gap that has a `debug_session:` field:
- Read the debug session file
- Update frontmatter `status:` → `resolved`
- Update frontmatter `updated:` timestamp
- Move to resolved directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .planning/debug/resolved
mv .planning/debug/{slug}.md .planning/debug/resolved/
```

**6. Commit updated artifacts:**
```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs commit "docs(objective-${PARENT_OBJECTIVE}): resolve UAT gaps and debug sessions after ${OBJECTIVE_NUMBER} gap closure" --files .planning/objectives/*${PARENT_OBJECTIVE}*/*-UAT.md .planning/debug/resolved/*.md
```

Read status:
```bash
grep "^status:" "$OBJECTIVE_DIR"/*-VERIFICATION.md | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d ' '
```

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `passed` | → update_roadmap |
| `human_needed` | Present items for human testing, get approval or feedback |
| `gaps_found` | → auto_gap_closure |

**If human_needed:**

Display items from VERIFICATION.md `human_verification` section, then for each item use AskUserQuestion:
```
AskUserQuestion(
  header: "Verify",
  question: "{item description from VERIFICATION.md}",
  multiSelect: false,
  options: [
    { label: "Verified", description: "This works correctly" },
    { label: "Issue found", description: "Something isn't right — I'll describe" },
    { label: "Can't test now", description: "Skip this item for now" }
  ]
)
```

If "Issue found": follow up with freeform "Describe the issue:" prompt. Collect all responses and route accordingly: all verified → proceed to `update_roadmap`. Any issues → `auto_gap_closure`.

**If gaps_found → auto_gap_closure:**

Automatically generate fix TRDs and execute them (replaces manual 3-command gap-closure).

```
GAP_CLOSURE_CYCLE=0
MAX_GAP_CYCLES=2
```

**While gaps exist AND GAP_CLOSURE_CYCLE < MAX_GAP_CYCLES:**

1. **Generate fix TRDs:**
   ```
   GAP_CLOSURE_CYCLE=$((GAP_CLOSURE_CYCLE + 1))
   ```

     description="Plan gap closure for Objective {objective_number}"
   )
   ```

2. **Execute fix TRDs:**
   Spawn executor agents for gap-closure TRDs (same wave-based execution as main execute step).

3. **Re-verify:**
   Re-run verification. Read new status.

   - `passed` → Break loop, continue to update_roadmap
   - `gaps_found` → Continue loop (next cycle)

**If still failing after MAX_GAP_CYCLES:**

```

**Score:** {N}/{M} must-haves verified
**Report:** {objective_dir}/{phase_num}-VERIFICATION.md

### Remaining Gaps
{Gap summaries from VERIFICATION.md}

Auto-fix could not resolve all gaps. Manual intervention needed.

Options:
- `/devflow:plan-objective {X} --gaps` — Manual gap closure planning
- `/devflow:verify-work {X}` — Manual testing
- `cat {objective_dir}/{phase_num}-VERIFICATION.md` — Full report
```

Stop auto-advance chain at this point.
</step>

<step name="update_roadmap">
**Mark objective complete and update all tracking files:**

```bash
COMPLETION=$(node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs objective complete "${OBJECTIVE_NUMBER}")
```

The CLI handles:
- Marking objective checkbox `[x]` with completion date
- Updating Progress table (Status → Complete, date)
- Updating job count to final
- Advancing STATE.md to next objective
- Updating REQUIREMENTS.md traceability

Extract from result: `next_objective`, `next_objective_name`, `is_last_objective`.

**Auto-reconcile ROADMAP drift (TRD 18-02):**

Before the final commit, reconcile any ROADMAP ↔ disk drift so the commit captures the corrected state in one atomic move. Non-blocking — failure produces a warning but does not abort completion.

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs sync-roadmap 2>/dev/null || {
  echo "Note: sync-roadmap reconcile skipped (CLI failed); continuing without ROADMAP drift correction."
}
```

**Auto-push to GitHub (TRD 18-02):**

Push state to the linked GitHub issue when the objective has one. Skipped silently when OBJECTIVE.md is absent or has no `github_issue` field. Auth failures emit a warning with remediation but don't abort.

```bash
OBJECTIVE_MD=".planning/objectives/${OBJECTIVE_DIR}/OBJECTIVE.md"
if [[ -f "$OBJECTIVE_MD" ]] && grep -qE '^github_issue:' "$OBJECTIVE_MD" 2>/dev/null; then
  node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs gh sync "${OBJECTIVE_NUMBER}" 2>/dev/null || {
    echo "Note: gh sync skipped for objective ${OBJECTIVE_NUMBER} (CLI failed; check 'gh auth status' if persistent); continuing."
  }
fi
```

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs commit "docs(objective-{X}): complete objective execution" --files .planning/ROADMAP.md .planning/STATE.md .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md .planning/objectives/{objective_dir}/*-VERIFICATION.md
```
</step>

<step name="offer_next">

**Exception:** If `gaps_found`, the `verify_objective_goal` step already presents the gap-closure path (`/devflow:plan-objective {X} --gaps`). No additional routing needed — skip auto-advance.

**Auto-advance detection:**

1. Parse `--auto` flag from $ARGUMENTS
2. Read `workflow.auto_advance` from config:
   ```bash
   AUTO_CFG=$(node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs config-get workflow.auto_advance 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
   ```

**If `--auto` flag present OR `AUTO_CFG` is true (AND verification passed with no gaps):**

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  AUTO-ADVANCING → TRANSITION             ║
║  Objective {X} verified, continuing chain    ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Execute the transition workflow inline (do NOT use Task — orchestrator context is ~10-15%, transition needs objective completion data already in context):

Read and follow `~/.claude/devflow/workflows/transition.md`, passing through the `--auto` flag so it propagates to the next objective invocation.

**If neither `--auto` nor `AUTO_CFG` is true:**

The workflow ends. The user runs `/devflow:status` or invokes the transition workflow manually.
</step>

</process>

<context_efficiency>
Orchestrator: ~10-15% context. Subagents: fresh 200k each. No polling (Task blocks). No context bleed.
</context_efficiency>

<failure_handling>
- **classifyHandoffIfNeeded false failure:** Agent reports "failed" but error is `classifyHandoffIfNeeded is not defined` → Claude Code bug, not DevFlow. Spot-check (SUMMARY exists, commits present) → if pass, treat as success
- **Agent fails mid-plan:** Missing SUMMARY.md → report, ask user how to proceed
- **Dependency chain breaks:** Wave 1 fails → Wave 2 dependents likely fail → user chooses attempt or skip
- **All agents in wave fail:** Systemic issue → stop, report for investigation
- **Checkpoint unresolvable:** "Skip this job?" or "Abort objective execution?" → record partial progress in STATE.md
</failure_handling>

<resumption>
Re-run `/devflow:execute-objective {objective}` → discover_plans finds completed SUMMARYs → skips them → resumes from first incomplete plan → continues wave execution.

STATE.md tracks: last completed plan, current wave, pending checkpoints.
</resumption>
