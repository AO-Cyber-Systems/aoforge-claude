<purpose>
Validate `.planning/` directory integrity and report actionable issues. Checks for missing files, invalid configurations, inconsistent state, and orphaned jobs. Optionally repairs auto-fixable issues.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.

<step name="parse_args">
**Parse arguments:**

Check if `--repair` flag is present in the command arguments.

```
REPAIR_FLAG=""
if arguments contain "--repair"; then
  REPAIR_FLAG="--repair"
fi
```

`--migrate` is also accepted (used by the intent-model migration flow). It does not
change which flags are passed to `validate health` itself, but it DOES trigger the
stack-profile offer in `offer_repair` below whenever a Check 12 issue (I030, W030,
W031, E030) is present — since a migration is exactly when a project is likely to
still be running on the general profile.
</step>

<step name="run_health_check">
**Run health validation:**

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs validate health $REPAIR_FLAG
```

Parse JSON output:
- `status`: "healthy" | "degraded" | "broken"
- `errors[]`: Critical issues (code, message, fix, repairable)
- `warnings[]`: Non-critical issues
- `info[]`: Informational notes
- `engine`: `{ running, mirror, installed, main }` — engine-lag row (`running` = the version the invoked df-tools reports; `mirror` = `~/.claude/devflow/.plugin-version`; `installed` = plugin-registry version; `main` = `origin/main`; any may be `null` when unknown)
- `repairable_count`: Number of auto-fixable issues
- `repairs_performed[]`: Actions taken if --repair was used
</step>

<step name="format_output">
**Format and display results:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 DevFlow Health Check
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Status: HEALTHY | DEGRADED | BROKEN
Engine: running <r> · mirror <m> · installed <i> · main <n>
Errors: N | Warnings: N | Info: N
```

(`Engine:` prints each `engine` field; substitute `n/a` for any `null`.)

**If repairs were performed:**
```
## Repairs Performed

- ✓ config.json: Created with defaults
- ✓ STATE.md: Regenerated from roadmap
```

**If errors exist:**
```
## Errors

- [E001] config.json: JSON parse error at line 5
  Fix: Run /devflow:health --repair to reset to defaults

- [E002] PROJECT.md not found
  Fix: Run /devflow:new-project to create
```

**If warnings exist:**
```
## Warnings

- [W001] STATE.md references objective 5, but only objectives 1-3 exist
  Fix: Run /devflow:health --repair to regenerate

- [W005] Objective directory "1-setup" doesn't follow NN-name format
  Fix: Rename to match pattern (e.g., 01-setup)
```

**If info exists:**
```
## Info

- [I001] 02-implementation/02-01-JOB.md has no SUMMARY.md
  Note: May be in progress
```

**Footer (if repairable issues exist and --repair was NOT used):**
```
---
N issues can be auto-repaired. Run: /devflow:health --repair
```
</step>

<step name="offer_repair">
**If repairable issues exist and --repair was NOT used:**

Ask user if they want to run repairs:

```
Would you like to run /devflow:health --repair to fix N issues automatically?
```

If yes, re-run with --repair flag and display results.

**Stack profile (Check 12) is never auto-repaired.** For I030 (and whenever
`--migrate` is passed), offer: preview with `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs
stack init --raw`, and on the user's yes run `stack init --write`. For W030/W031/E030,
show `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs stack validate` output and let the user
edit `.planning/STACK.md`. If `stack` is an unknown command (older mirror), say so and
skip.
</step>

<step name="verify_repairs">
**If repairs were performed:**

Re-run health check without --repair to confirm issues are resolved:

```bash
node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs validate health
```

Report final status.

<repair_actions>

| Action | Effect | Risk |
|--------|--------|------|
| createConfig | Create config.json with defaults | None |
| resetConfig | Delete + recreate config.json | Loses custom settings |
| regenerateState | Create STATE.md from ROADMAP structure | Loses session history |

**Not repairable (too risky):**
- PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md content
- Objective directory renaming
- Orphaned plan cleanup
