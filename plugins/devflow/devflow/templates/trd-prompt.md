# Task Requirements Document (TRD) Template

> **Note:** Planning methodology is in `agents/planner.md`.
> This template defines the TRD.md output format that the agent produces.
> TRD replaces JOB.md as the primary execution document. Old JOB.md files still work for backward compatibility.

Template for `.planning/objectives/XX-name/{objective}-{trd}-TRD.md` - self-contained task documents optimized for parallel execution.

**Naming:** Use `{objective}-{trd}-TRD.md` format (e.g., `01-02-TRD.md` for Objective 1, TRD 2)

## Key Differences from JOB.md

| Feature | JOB.md (legacy) | TRD.md (v2) |
|---|---|---|
| Field name | `job: NN` | `trd: NN` |
| Context | `@path` references only | `<embedded_context>` with actual code |
| Examples | None | `<codebase_examples>` with real patterns |
| Anti-patterns | None | `<anti_patterns>` per-TRD |
| Recovery | None | `<recovery>` per task + `<error_recovery>` |
| TDD tasks | `tdd="true"` attribute | `type="tdd"` with structured RED/GREEN |
| Evidence | Optional | Required per-task verification |
| Flutter UI fields | None | Optional fields when `type: ui` (REQ-10-01) |

## Backward Compatibility

Old JOB.md files continue to work. The system detects file suffix:
- Files ending in `-TRD.md` use TRD format
- Files ending in `-JOB.md` use legacy JOB format
- When both exist for same objective, TRD takes precedence

---

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `objective` | Yes | Objective identifier (e.g., `01-foundation`) |
| `trd` | Yes | TRD number within objective (e.g., `01`, `02`) |
| `type` | Yes | `standard`, `tdd`, or `ui` |
| `wave` | Yes | Execution wave number (1, 2, 3...) |
| `depends_on` | Yes | Array of TRD IDs this task requires |
| `files_modified` | Yes | Files this TRD touches |
| `autonomous` | Yes | `true` if no checkpoints, `false` if has checkpoints |
| `requirements` | Yes | **MUST** list requirement IDs from ROADMAP |
| `user_setup` | No | Array of human-required setup items |
| `must_haves` | Yes | Goal-backward verification criteria |

### Flutter UI fields (optional; required semantically when `type: ui`)

| Field | Required when `type: ui` | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `stack` | Yes | Stack family. Currently only `flutter` is meaningful. |
| `platform` | Yes | Array of `mobile`, `web`. **Default `[mobile, web]`** — BOTH platforms are required coverage for Flutter UI TRDs. Narrow only if a TRD genuinely targets a single platform. |
| `state_management` | Yes | One of `riverpod`, `bloc`, `setState`, `provider`, `other`. Drives state-coverage regex set (see `references/flutter-state-patterns.md`). |
| `api_contract` | No | List of `{path, sha}` for SHA-pinning referenced contract files. Drift detection is advisory. |
| `must_haves.artifacts[*].states` | Yes (per artifact) | Non-empty list of state names this artifact must render and test. Example: `[loading, data, error, empty]`. |
| `must_haves.artifacts[*].tests.widget` | Yes (per artifact) | Path to widget test file. |
| `must_haves.artifacts[*].tests.integration` | Yes (per artifact) | Path to integration_test file. **Single path used by BOTH platforms.** Mobile runs `flutter test <path>` (or `flutter test integration_test/`); web runs `flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=<path> -d chrome`. The `test_driver/integration_test.dart` driver is auto-scaffolded by TRD 10-04a's bootstrap task. |
| `must_haves.artifacts[*].tests.maestro` | Yes (per artifact) | Path to Maestro flow YAML. **Mobile-only BY DESIGN** — Maestro on Flutter web has an upstream blocker (mobile-dev-inc/maestro#2591) so the web-tier black-box verifier is `flutter drive` instead of Maestro. There is no web opt-in flag; web coverage flows entirely through `tests.integration` via `flutter drive`. |

**Enforcement model:** These fields are NOT in `FRONTMATTER_SCHEMAS.trd.required`. A non-Flutter TRD that omits them validates fine. The planner agent (`agents/planner.md` `<step name="break_into_tasks">`) calls `df-tools detect flutter-ui-scope <objective>`; if scope detected, it semantically requires these fields and emits `## PLANNING INCONCLUSIVE` for missing ones. See TRD 10-03.

**Web verification mechanism:** `tests.integration` is a single source path; the executor (TRD 10-04b) invokes it twice — once for each platform — using different drivers. Mobile uses the standard `flutter test` runner. Web uses `flutter drive` plus a chromedriver, with `test_driver/integration_test.dart` serving as the driver entrypoint. This substitution model — `flutter drive` IS the web-tier black-box verifier — exists because Maestro's web semantics overlay is broken upstream (issue mobile-dev-inc/maestro#2591). See TRD 10-02 for the full rationale.
