# Objective Prompt Template

> **Note:** Planning methodology is in `agents/planner.md`.
> This template defines the JOB.md output format that the agent produces.

Template for `.planning/objectives/XX-name/{objective}-{job}-JOB.md` - executable objective plans optimized for parallel execution.

**Naming:** Use `{objective}-{job}-JOB.md` format (e.g., `01-02-JOB.md` for Objective 1, Job 2)

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `objective` | Yes | Objective identifier (e.g., `01-foundation`) |
| `job` | Yes | Job number within objective (e.g., `01`, `02`) |
| `type` | Yes | Always `execute` for standard jobs, `tdd` for TDD jobs |
| `wave` | Yes | Execution wave number (1, 2, 3...). Pre-computed at plan time. |
| `depends_on` | Yes | Array of plan IDs this job requires. |
| `files_modified` | Yes | Files this job touches. |
| `autonomous` | Yes | `true` if no checkpoints, `false` if has checkpoints |
| `requirements` | Yes | **MUST** list requirement IDs from ROADMAP. Every roadmap requirement MUST appear in at least one plan. |
| `user_setup` | No | Array of human-required setup items (external services) |
| `validation_gates` | No | Runnable lint/test/build commands from STACK.md |
| `must_haves` | Yes | Goal-backward verification criteria (see below) |
| `github_issue` | No | Per-TRD override (rare). Inherits from OBJECTIVE.md unless set. |

**Wave is pre-computed:** Wave numbers are assigned during `/devflow:plan-objective`. Execute-objective reads `wave` directly from frontmatter and groups plans by wave number. No runtime dependency analysis needed.

**Must-haves enable verification:** The `must_haves` field carries goal-backward requirements from planning to execution. After all jobs complete, execute-objective spawns a verification subagent that checks these criteria against the actual codebase.

**GitHub-link inheritance:** TRDs inherit `github_issue`, `parent_issue`, `org_initiative`, `org_project` from OBJECTIVE.md (which inherits from PROJECT.md). Per-TRD override is rare — set `github_issue` here only when this TRD has its own GH issue distinct from the parent objective.

## Parallel vs Sequential

<parallel_examples>

**Wave 1 candidates (parallel):**

```yaml
# Job 01 - User feature
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified: [src/models/user.ts, src/api/users.ts]
autonomous: true

# Job 02 - Product feature (no overlap with Job 01)
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified: [src/models/product.ts, src/api/products.ts]
autonomous: true

# Job 03 - Order feature (no overlap)
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified: [src/models/order.ts, src/api/orders.ts]
autonomous: true
```

All three run in parallel (Wave 1) - no dependencies, no file conflicts.

**Sequential (genuine dependency):**

```yaml
# Job 01 - Auth foundation
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified: [src/lib/auth.ts, src/middleware/auth.ts]
autonomous: true

# Job 02 - Protected features (needs auth)
wave: 2
depends_on: ["01"]
files_modified: [src/features/dashboard.ts]
autonomous: true
```

Job 02 in Wave 2 waits for Job 01 in Wave 1 - genuine dependency on auth types/middleware.

**Checkpoint plan:**

```yaml
# Job 03 - UI with verification
wave: 3
depends_on: ["01", "02"]
files_modified: [src/components/Dashboard.tsx]
autonomous: false  # Has checkpoint:human-verify
```

Wave 3 runs after Waves 1 and 2. Pauses at checkpoint, orchestrator presents to user, resumes on approval.

</parallel_examples>

---

## Context Section

**Parallel-aware context:**

```markdown
<context>
@.planning/PROJECT.md
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
@.planning/STATE.md

# Only include SUMMARY refs if genuinely needed:
# - This job imports types from prior job
# - Prior job made decision affecting this job
# - Prior job's output is input to this job
#
# Independent plans need NO prior SUMMARY references.
# Do NOT reflexively chain: 02 refs 01, 03 refs 02...

@src/relevant/source.ts
</context>
```

**Bad pattern (creates false dependencies):**
```markdown
<context>
@.planning/objectives/03-features/03-01-SUMMARY.md  # Just because it's earlier
@.planning/objectives/03-features/03-02-SUMMARY.md  # Reflexive chaining
</context>
```

---

## Scope Guidance

**Plan sizing:**

- 2-3 tasks per job
- ~50% context usage maximum
- Complex objectives: Multiple focused plans, not one large plan

**When to split:**

- Different subsystems (auth vs API vs UI)
- >3 tasks
- Risk of context overflow
- TDD candidates - separate jobs

**Vertical slices preferred:**

```
PREFER: Job 01 = User (model + API + UI)
        Job 02 = Product (model + API + UI)

AVOID:  Job 01 = All models
        Job 02 = All APIs
        Job 03 = All UIs
```

---

## TDD Plans

TDD features get dedicated jobs with `type: tdd`.

**Heuristic:** Can you write `expect(fn(input)).toBe(output)` before writing `fn`?
→ Yes: Create a TDD job
→ No: Standard task in standard job

See `~/.claude/devflow/references/tdd.md` for TDD job structure.

---

## Task Types

| Type | Use For | Autonomy |
|------|---------|----------|
| `auto` | Everything Claude can do independently | Fully autonomous |
| `checkpoint:human-verify` | Visual/functional verification | Pauses, returns to orchestrator |
| `checkpoint:decision` | Implementation choices | Pauses, returns to orchestrator |
| `checkpoint:human-action` | Truly unavoidable manual steps (rare) | Pauses, returns to orchestrator |

**Checkpoint behavior in parallel execution:**
- Plan runs until checkpoint
- Agent returns with checkpoint details + agent_id
- Orchestrator presents to user
- User responds
- Orchestrator resumes agent with `resume: agent_id`

---

## Examples

**Autonomous parallel plan:**

```markdown

objective: 03-features
job: 01
type: execute
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified: [src/features/user/model.ts, src/features/user/api.ts, src/features/user/UserList.tsx]
autonomous: true

## Anti-Patterns

**Bad: Reflexive dependency chaining**
```yaml
depends_on: ["03-01"]  # Just because 01 comes before 02
```

**Bad: Horizontal layer grouping**
```
Job 01: All models
Job 02: All APIs (depends on 01)
Job 03: All UIs (depends on 02)
```

**Bad: Missing autonomy flag**
```yaml
# Has checkpoint but no autonomous: false
depends_on: []
files_modified: [...]
# autonomous: ???  <- Missing!
```

**Bad: Vague tasks**
```xml
<task type="auto">
  <name>Set up authentication</name>
  <action>Add auth to the app</action>
</task>
```

---

## Guidelines

- Always use XML structure for Claude parsing
- Include `wave`, `depends_on`, `files_modified`, `autonomous` in every plan
- Prefer vertical slices over horizontal layers
- Only reference prior SUMMARYs when genuinely needed
- Group checkpoints with related auto tasks in same job
- 2-3 tasks per job, ~50% context max
- Include `<file_tree>` when the job creates 2+ new files. Use `← CREATE` for new files, `← MODIFY` for existing files. Skip for plans that only modify existing files.
- Include `<research_context>` when RESEARCH.md exists and is relevant to the job's scope. Only include findings that directly affect THIS job's tasks — not the entire research document.
- Include `<gotchas>` when the job touches areas flagged in CONCERNS.md, uses libraries with known quirks from RESEARCH.md, or involves patterns that commonly go wrong.
- Include `<validation_gates>` populated from STACK.md with runnable lint/test/build commands. These are job-level — run after all tasks complete.

---

## User Setup (External Services)

When a plan introduces external services requiring human configuration, declare in frontmatter:

```yaml
user_setup:
  - service: stripe
    why: "Payment processing requires API keys"
    env_vars:
      - name: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
        source: "Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API keys → Secret key"
      - name: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
        source: "Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Signing secret"
    dashboard_config:
      - task: "Create webhook endpoint"
        location: "Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint"
        details: "URL: https://[your-domain]/api/webhooks/stripe"
    local_dev:
      - "stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe"
```

**The automation-first rule:** `user_setup` contains ONLY what Claude literally cannot do:
- Account creation (requires human signup)
- Secret retrieval (requires dashboard access)
- Dashboard configuration (requires human in browser)

**NOT included:** Package installs, code changes, file creation, CLI commands Claude can run.

**Result:** Execute-plan generates `{objective}-USER-SETUP.md` with checklist for the user.

See `~/.claude/devflow/templates/user-setup.md` for full schema and examples

---

## Must-Haves (Goal-Backward Verification)

The `must_haves` field defines what must be TRUE for the objective goal to be achieved. Derived during planning, verified after execution.

**Structure:**

```yaml
must_haves:
  truths:
    - "User can see existing messages"
    - "User can send a message"
    - "Messages persist across refresh"
  artifacts:
    - path: "src/components/Chat.tsx"
      provides: "Message list rendering"
      min_lines: 30
    - path: "src/app/api/chat/route.ts"
      provides: "Message CRUD operations"
      exports: ["GET", "POST"]
    - path: "prisma/schema.prisma"
      provides: "Message model"
      contains: "model Message"
  key_links:
    - from: "src/components/Chat.tsx"
      to: "/api/chat"
      via: "fetch in useEffect"
      pattern: "fetch.*api/chat"
    - from: "src/app/api/chat/route.ts"
      to: "prisma.message"
      via: "database query"
      pattern: "prisma\\.message\\.(find|create)"
```

**Field descriptions:**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `truths` | Observable behaviors from user perspective. Each must be testable. |
| `artifacts` | Files that must exist with real implementation. |
| `artifacts[].path` | File path relative to project root. |
| `artifacts[].provides` | What this artifact delivers. |
| `artifacts[].min_lines` | Optional. Minimum lines to be considered substantive. |
| `artifacts[].exports` | Optional. Expected exports to verify. |
| `artifacts[].contains` | Optional. Pattern that must exist in file. |
| `key_links` | Critical connections between artifacts. |
| `key_links[].from` | Source artifact. |
| `key_links[].to` | Target artifact or endpoint. |
| `key_links[].via` | How they connect (description). |
| `key_links[].pattern` | Optional. Regex to verify connection exists. |

**Why this matters:**

Task completion ≠ Goal achievement. A task "create chat component" can complete by creating a placeholder. The `must_haves` field captures what must actually work, enabling verification to catch gaps before they compound.

**Verification flow:**

1. Plan-objective derives must_haves from objective goal (goal-backward)
2. Must_haves written to JOB.md frontmatter
3. Execute-objective runs all jobs
4. Verification subagent checks must_haves against codebase
5. Gaps found → fix plans created → execute → re-verify
6. All must_haves pass → objective complete

See `~/.claude/devflow/workflows/verify-objective.md` for verification logic.
