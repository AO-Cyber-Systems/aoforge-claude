# TRD Specification

The structure, frontmatter, and field semantics for TRD.md files. Referenced by planner during plan generation; consulted by executor, verifier, and job-checker during their respective phases.

**ripgrep flags in `<verify>` and `<done>`.** In `rg`, `-E` is `--encoding`, not extended regex (unlike GNU `grep -E` / `egrep`). Never fold `E` into an rg flag cluster such as `-nE`: ripgrep reads the next argument as an encoding name and the check breaks. For alternation write `rg -n -e 'foo|bar'` (or repeat `-e` once per alternative); for PCRE features write `rg -nP 'pattern'`. CI enforces this over live plugin prose (`bin/lib/rg-flag-guard.test.cjs`).

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `objective` | Yes | Objective identifier (e.g., `01-foundation`) |
| `trd` | Yes | TRD number within objective |
| `type` | Yes | `standard` or `tdd` |
| `wave` | Yes | Execution wave number |
| `depends_on` | Yes | Plan IDs this TRD requires |
| `files_modified` | Yes | Files this TRD touches |
| `autonomous` | Yes | `true` if no checkpoints |
| `requirements` | Yes | **MUST** list requirement IDs from ROADMAP. Every roadmap requirement ID MUST appear in at least one TRD. |
| `user_setup` | No | Human-required setup items |
| `decision_gate` | No | Decision id (e.g., `DECISION-001`) that must be resolved before this TRD can start; absent = independent |
| `validation_gates` | No | Runnable lint/test/build commands from STACK.md |
| `must_haves` | Yes | Goal-backward verification criteria |

Wave numbers are pre-computed during planning. Execute-objective reads `wave` directly from frontmatter.

## Per-Task Caution

Tasks may declare a caution attribute: `<task type="auto" caution="pause-before-destructive">`.

| Caution value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `pause-before-destructive` | Pause before file deletions, schema drops, force pushes, mass-rewrites. Surface what will be destroyed; require confirmation. |
| (absent) | Standard execution. No caution behavior. |

Other values are warned and treated as absent. There is no TRD-level confidence flag — caution is per-task and opt-in.

**Back-compat:** TRDs may still carry a `confidence:` frontmatter field from in-flight planning. Ignore it — do not error, do not branch on it.

## decision_gate Frontmatter Field

`decision_gate` is an optional field that links a TRD to a pending decision in the decision queue. When present, the TRD cannot start until the named decision is resolved.

**Set by:** the planner, when a TRD's implementation path depends on a choice that has been parked (by a `checkpoint:decision` or a Rule 4 architectural stop) during autonomous execution.

**Consumed by:**
- `execute-objective.md`: computes the blocked set when parking a decision (TRDs with a matching `decision_gate` plus their transitive `depends_on` closure).
- `df-tools decision-queue computeBlockedSet`: recomputes the blocked set at resume time for `/devflow:decide`.

**Value format:** A `DECISION-NNN` id matching the filename in `.planning/decisions/pending/`.

**Absent = independent.** A TRD without `decision_gate` is always eligible to execute (subject to normal `depends_on` ordering).

**Example — a TRD gated on a parked architectural decision:**

```yaml
---
objective: 05-payments
trd: "03"
type: standard
wave: 2
depends_on: ["05-02"]
files_modified: [src/payments/processor.ts]
autonomous: true
requirements: [PAY-03]
decision_gate: DECISION-001
---
```

In this example, TRD 05-03 will be skipped during autonomous execution until `DECISION-001` is resolved via `/devflow:decide DECISION-001 <choice>`, which unblocks it for the next `/devflow:execute-objective` run.

## Context Section Rules

Only include prior TRD SUMMARY references if genuinely needed (uses types/exports from prior TRD, or prior TRD made decision affecting this one).

**Anti-pattern:** Reflexive chaining (02 refs 01, 03 refs 02...). Independent plans need NO prior SUMMARY references.

## User Setup Frontmatter

When external services involved:

```yaml
user_setup:
  - service: stripe
    why: "Payment processing"
    env_vars:
      - name: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
        source: "Stripe Dashboard -> Developers -> API keys"
    dashboard_config:
      - task: "Create webhook endpoint"
        location: "Stripe Dashboard -> Developers -> Webhooks"
```

Only include what Claude literally cannot do.
