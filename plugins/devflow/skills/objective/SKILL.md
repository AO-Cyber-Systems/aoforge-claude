  Add or remove an objective from the current milestone roadmap.
  Subcommand-style: /devflow:objective add | remove
  Use when explicitly requested.
  Note: 'insert' (decimal objectives) was removed in v1.2 — use 'add' instead.

<objective>
Manage objectives in the current milestone roadmap. Routes by first argument:
- `add <description>` — Add a new integer objective to the end of the milestone
- `remove <number> [--force] [--confirm]` — Preview the removal + renumber plan. Store mode refuses deletes; close the objective with `df-tools objective set-status <id> cancelled` instead.
  Dry-run by default: without `--confirm` nothing is deleted or renamed.
  `--confirm` authorizes the destructive cascade (delete the objective, then
  renumber every subsequent objective's directory, the files inside it, and its
  ROADMAP references).
  `--force` separately overrides the refusal to remove an objective that has
  executed SUMMARY.md jobs. Removing an executed objective needs BOTH flags.

Replaces 3 sibling skills: add-objective, insert-objective, remove-objective.
Note: decimal objectives (insert) were removed in v1.2 (TRD 12-06, I2 survey: 0% usage).

**1. Resolve subcommand and workflow:**

```bash
ROUTE_JSON=$(node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs skill-route objective $ARGUMENTS --raw)
```

Parse the JSON. If it contains `error`, display the `usage` field to the user and stop. Otherwise extract `subcommand`, `args`, and `workflow`.

**2. Follow the resolved workflow.**

Based on `subcommand`:
- `add` → execute the add-objective workflow loaded above with the residual args
- `remove` → execute the remove-objective workflow with the residual args

Pass residual `args` to the workflow as if the user had typed them.

**3. Display deprecation summary if invoked via redirect** (handled by redirect skills; this consolidated skill does not log deprecation itself).
