<objective>
Execute all jobs in an objective using wave-based parallel execution.

Orchestrator stays lean: discover plans, analyze dependencies, group into waves, spawn subagents, collect results. Each subagent loads the full execute-trd context and handles its own TRD.

Context budget: ~15% orchestrator, 100% fresh per subagent.

**Flags:**
- `--gaps-only` — Execute only gap closure plans (plans with `gap_closure: true` in frontmatter). Use after verify-work creates fix plans.

<process>
Execute the execute-objective workflow from @~/.claude/devflow/workflows/execute-objective.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (wave execution, checkpoint handling, verification, state updates, routing).
