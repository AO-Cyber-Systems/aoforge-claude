  Manage todos: capture an idea/task or view the morning standup across local + GitHub + peer sources.
  Subcommand-style: /devflow:todo add | list
  Use when the user wants to save something for later, note an idea, or get a "what should I work on?" view.
  Triggers on: "remember to", "add a todo", "save this idea", "what should I work on?", "morning standup", "check todos".

<objective>
Manage todos. Routes by first argument:
- `add [description]` — Capture an idea/task from current conversation
- `list [--all|--lane|--refresh|--raw]` — Morning standup view across 5 sources

Replaces 2 sibling skills: add-todo, check-todos.

Todo files go through the verbs. Never write, edit or move a file under `.planning/todos/` directly. Add with
`node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs todo add --from <draft>` (draft path from `planning draft todos/pending/<stem>.md`)
and complete with `node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs todo complete <filename>`. In local mode they write the same
`.planning/todos/` files; with `github.store` on each todo is also a GitHub issue.

**1. Resolve subcommand and workflow:**

```bash
ROUTE_JSON=$(node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs skill-route todo $ARGUMENTS --raw)
```

Parse JSON. If `error`, display `usage` and stop. Otherwise extract `subcommand`, `args`, and `workflow`.

**2. Follow resolved workflow:**

Based on `subcommand`:
- `add` → execute add-todo workflow with residual args
- `list` → execute check-todos workflow with residual args (passes `--all`, `--lane`, etc. through)

Pass residual `args` to the workflow as if the user had typed them.
