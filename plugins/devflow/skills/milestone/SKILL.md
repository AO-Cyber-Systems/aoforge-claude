<objective>
Manage milestones in the current project. Routes by first argument:
- `new [name]` — Start the next development cycle (questioning → research → requirements → roadmap)
- `audit [version]` — Verify a milestone achieved its definition of done
- `complete <version>` — Archive milestone and tag git release
- `gaps` — Turn audit gaps into new objectives that close them

Replaces 4 sibling skills: new-milestone, audit-milestone, complete-milestone, plan-milestone-gaps.
</objective>

<process>
**1. Resolve subcommand and workflow:**

```bash
ROUTE_JSON=$(node ~/.claude/devflow/bin/df-tools.cjs skill-route milestone $ARGUMENTS --raw)
```

Parse the JSON. If it contains `error`, display `usage` and stop. Otherwise extract `subcommand`, `args`, and `workflow`.

**2. Follow the resolved workflow.**

Based on `subcommand`:
- `new` → execute new-milestone workflow with residual args (the name, if provided)
- `audit` → execute audit-milestone workflow with residual args (the version, if provided)
- `complete` → execute complete-milestone workflow with residual args (the version, REQUIRED)
- `gaps` → execute plan-milestone-gaps workflow with residual args

Pass residual `args` to the workflow as `$ARGUMENTS`.
