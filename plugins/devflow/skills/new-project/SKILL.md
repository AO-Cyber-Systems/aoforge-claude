**Flags:**
- `--auto` — Automatic mode. After config questions, runs research → requirements → roadmap without further interaction. Expects idea document via @ reference.
</context>

<objective>
Initialize a new project through unified flow: questioning → research (optional) → requirements → roadmap.

**Creates:**
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — project context
- `.planning/config.json` — workflow preferences
- `.planning/research/` — domain research (optional)
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped requirements
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — objective structure
- `.planning/STATE.md` — project memory

**After this command:** Run `/devflow:plan-objective 1` to start execution.
</objective>
