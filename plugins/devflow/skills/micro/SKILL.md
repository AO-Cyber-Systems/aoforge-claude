  Sub-30-LOC, single-file changes. The cheapest DevFlow path (~2k tokens). Use for typo fixes, single-line bug fixes, prop renames, dependency bumps, missing semicolons.
  Triggers on: "fix typo", "rename X to Y", "1-line fix", "single-file change", "tiny", "trivial"

<objective>
Execute sub-30-LOC, single-file changes with atomic-commit guarantees and STATE.md tracking (local mode), in a single context window.

Micro is the FLOOR of the DevFlow ladder:
- No planner, no executor, no verifier — Claude makes the edit inline
- No JOB.md, no TRD.md, no SUMMARY.md
- No CLAUDE.md / playbook absorption (mirrors /devflow:quick's no-ceremony posture)
- Commit format: `chore(micro): {description}`
- STATE.md "Quick Tasks Completed" table receives an entry on commit (local mode only), recorded by `df-tools micro commit` (never a hand edit). With `github.store` on, STATE.md is a generated view and micro leaves it unchanged

Cost target: ~2k tokens (skill body + df-tools output). For changes that exceed sub-30-LOC or touch multiple files, prefer /devflow:quick (<5 files, <200 LOC) or /devflow:build (multi-file features).
