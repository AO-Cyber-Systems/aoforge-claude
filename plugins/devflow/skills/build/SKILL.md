<objective>
Build an objective from start to finish: research → plan → execute → verify → done.

This is the primary way to build with DevFlow. One command, shipped code.

Usage:
- `/devflow:build 3` — Build objective 3 from the roadmap
- `/devflow:build "add user authentication"` — Build from description (creates temporary objective if no match)
- `/devflow:build 3 --pause` — Stop between phases for review
- `/devflow:build 3 --skip-research` — Skip research phase
- `/devflow:build 3 --work refactor` — Override the resolved work type for this objective
- `/devflow:build 3 --tdd skip` — Override TDD posture (use sparingly; documents itself in OBJECTIVE.md)

**Intent override flags** are forwarded to the planner phase and persisted in OBJECTIVE.md so the executor honors them. See `/devflow:plan-objective` for full enum values.
