<objective>
Switch the model profile used by AOForge agents. Controls which Claude model each agent uses, balancing quality vs token spend.

Routes to the set-profile workflow which handles:
- Argument validation (quality/balanced/budget)
- Config file creation if missing
- Profile update in config.json
- Confirmation with model table display
</objective>
