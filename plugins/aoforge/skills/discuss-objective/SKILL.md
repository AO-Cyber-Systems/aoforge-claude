description: |
  Capture implementation decisions for an objective before planning — lock in preferences so research and planning don't drift into assumptions.
  Use when the user wants to shape how an objective gets built before tasks are generated.

<objective>
Extract implementation decisions that downstream agents (objective-researcher, planner) need. Surface the gray areas in the objective, let the user pick what to discuss, then deep-dive until decisions are crisp enough to act on.

**Output:** `.aoforge/objectives/<obj>/CONTEXT.md` — captures decisions about layout, data, UX, dependencies, and explicit "Claude's Discretion" items. Feeds directly into research queries and planner task specs.

**Not the job:** figuring out HOW to implement. That happens in research + planning using the decisions captured here.

<process>
Execute the discuss-objective workflow end-to-end. Publish CONTEXT.md when decisions are locked (draft, then
`node ~/.claude/aoforge/bin/aof-tools.cjs doc put objectives/<dir>/<NN>-CONTEXT.md --from <draft>`). Do not proceed to planning — the user runs `/aoforge:plan-objective <N>` when ready.
