<purpose>
Create `.continue-here.md` handoff file to preserve complete work state across sessions. Enables seamless resumption with full context restoration.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.

<step name="detect">
Find current objective directory from most recently modified files:

```bash
# Find most recent objective directory with work
ls -lt .planning/objectives/*/JOB.md 2>/dev/null | head -1 | grep -oP 'objectives/\K[^/]+'
```

If no active objective is detected, list the objective directories under `.planning/objectives/`, most recently
modified first, and ask which one the pause is for:

```
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    header: "Objective",
    question: "Which objective are you pausing work on? Under Other, type its number.",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "{NN-name 1}", description: "Last modified {age}" },
      { label: "{NN-name 2}", description: "Last modified {age}" },
      { label: "{NN-name 3}", description: "Last modified {age}" },
      { label: "{NN-name 4}", description: "Last modified {age}" }
    ]
  }
])
```

Runtime-list rule: up to 4 objectives become the options (at least 2; with exactly one, `Pause {NN-name} (Recommended)`
/ `Cancel`). With more than 4, print the numbered list, offer the 4 most recent and the user types a number under Other.
</step>

<step name="gather">
**Collect complete state for handoff:**

1. **Current position**: Which objective, which plan, which task
2. **Work completed**: What got done this session
3. **Work remaining**: What's left in current job/objective
4. **Decisions made**: Key decisions and rationale
5. **Blockers/issues**: Anything stuck
6. **Mental context**: The approach, next steps, "vibe"
7. **Files modified**: What's changed but not committed

Ask user for clarifications if needed via conversational questions.
</step>

<step name="write">
**Write handoff to `.planning/objectives/XX-name/.continue-here.md`:**

Be specific enough for a fresh Claude to understand immediately.

Use `current-timestamp` for last_updated field. You can use init todos (which provides timestamps) or call directly:
```bash
timestamp=$(node ~/.claude/aoforge/bin/aof-tools.cjs current-timestamp full --raw)
```
</step>

<step name="commit">
```bash
node ~/.claude/aoforge/bin/aof-tools.cjs commit "wip: [phase-name] paused at task [X]/[Y]" --files .planning/objectives/*/.continue-here.md
```
</step>

<step name="confirm">
```
✓ Handoff created: .planning/objectives/[XX-name]/.continue-here.md

Current state:

- Objective: [XX-name]
- Task: [X] of [Y]
- Status: [in_progress/blocked]
- Committed as WIP

To resume: /aoforge:status resume

```

</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] .continue-here.md created in correct objective directory
- [ ] All sections filled with specific content
- [ ] Committed as WIP
- [ ] User knows location and how to resume
