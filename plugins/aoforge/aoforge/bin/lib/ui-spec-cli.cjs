/**
 * ui-spec-cli — the `aof-tools ui spec …` arms (objective 34-04).
 *
 *   cmdUiSpec(cwd, args, raw)   ->  `validate` and `render`.
 *   cmdUiSheet(cwd, args, raw)  ->  `aof-tools ui sheet …`, a THIRD `ui` subcommand beside
 *                                   `metrics` and `spec` (§8.3 names it `ui sheet <surface>`).
 *   cmdUiLock(cwd, args, raw)   ->  `aof-tools ui lock …`, a FOURTH one: the look-lock a human's
 *                                   approval actually runs (34-07).
 *
 * ── The one thing this file exists to get right ───────────────────────────────
 * The plan's W1b gate for this row is literally `aof-tools ui spec validate <file>` **exit 1
 * with codes**. So:
 *
 *   * stdout is written HERE, directly, and the exit code is set with `process.exitCode` —
 *     never `process.exit()`, which can truncate a buffered write, and never
 *     `helpers.cjs`'s `output()`, which calls `process.exit(0)` UNCONDITIONALLY and would
 *     make this gate structurally incapable of failing. Same decision, same reasoning as
 *     `flutter-ui-eval.cjs`'s `outputRollup()`; `output()` itself is not touched, because a
 *     dozen callers depend on its exit-0 behaviour.
 *   * `exitCodeFor(verdict)` — not the presence of error records — drives the code, and it is
 *     the ONLY thing that does. An arm with its own `ok ? 0 : 1` is a second definition of what
 *     the gate means.
 *
 * ── THREE outcomes, three codes (issue #90) ───────────────────────────────────
 *   0  every check ran and nothing violated
 *   1  a real violation — the plan's W1b gate, unchanged
 *   2  nothing violated, but one or more checks DID NOT RUN
 *
 * A MISSING row (PAT000, HIT000) is a check that could not run: not a pass, not a failure, and
 * never an exit 1. It used to be an exit 0, which is the same thing as a pass to the shell
 * idiom every gate is written with — `validate "$spec" || exit 1` — and so an invariant that was
 * never evaluated read as verified. `2` is that outcome's own number: `|| exit 1` fails on it,
 * and a caller who genuinely accepts an incomplete check says so (`[ $? -eq 2 ]`) rather than
 * inheriting it by accident.
 *
 * For `render`, `sheet` and `lock`, **exit 2 means the artifact WAS produced**. Only 1 refuses.
 *
 * ── The arm holds NO rules ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It resolves argv, reads the file, calls `parseSurfaceSpec` then `validateSurfaceSpec`,
 * prints, and sets the code. Every invariant lives in `ui-spec-validate.cjs` where the
 * known-broken fixtures can reach it without a subprocess.
 *
 * ── `render`, and why it shares validate's front half (34-05) ─────────────────
 * `ui spec render <file> [--manifest|--graph|--table]` derives the four artifacts of §4.1's
 * one-file rule. It parses and validates FIRST, and an invalid spec renders NOTHING and exits
 * 1 — a manifest, a graph and a table derived from a spec nobody checked look authoritative
 * and are not, and everything downstream treats them as the truth. With no flag it prints all
 * four under named keys, so a caller wanting everything does not run the arm three times and
 * hope the runs agree.
 *
 * A MISSING row does NOT refuse the render (it is not a violation) and is NOT swallowed
 * either: it is written to STDERR as an advisory. stdout carries only the artifact, because
 * the byte-stability contract diffs stdout.
 *
 * ── The pattern catalogue (I5) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `ctx.patterns` is `undefined` when the catalogue is UNREACHABLE and an array when it is
 * reachable. W1b has no pinned `eden-ui-flutter` release, so the default is `undefined` and
 * I5 reports PAT000/MISSING. Passing `[]` instead would fire PAT001 on every real spec, and
 * reporting nothing would turn an unreachable catalogue into a silent pass.
 * `--patterns <file>` supplies one explicitly — a JSON array (or `{patterns: [...]}`) of
 * catalogue entries. It exists so I5's codes are reachable from the REAL binary: without it
 * the `unknown-pattern.md` fixture's defect can never be proven through the gate, and a gate
 * that cannot fail for one of its own fixtures is the trap this objective exists to close.
 * A `--patterns` file that cannot be read is a one-line refusal, NOT a fallback to MISSING:
 * the caller asked for a catalogue, so hiding the typo would be the same silent pass.
 *
 * Consumed by: bin/aof-tools.cjs `case 'ui'`.
 * Depends on: ./ui-spec.cjs, ./ui-spec-validate.cjs, ./helpers.cjs. No npm dependencies.
