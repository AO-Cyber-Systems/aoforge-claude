/**
 * flutter-ui-eval-planner-default.cjs — P5 planner auto-emit default (UI-VISUAL-EVAL-AOFORGE-03).
 *
 * Pure decision: given a flutter-ui-scope detection result, decide whether the planner
 * should auto-emit a ui-eval state-matrix manifest STUB (Shape-A) + declare the verifier
 * VISUAL GATE (verifier Step 8c runs `aof-tools verify flutter-ui-eval`). This is exactly
 * parallel to how flutter-state-coverage (REQ-10-05) is auto-required in the planner's
 * Flutter UI scope sub-procedure.
 *
 * Contract: visual eval is opt-OUT, not opt-in. A detected Flutter UI objective is born
 * with the gate; a non-ui objective gets neither stub nor gate.
 *
 * Pure logic — no fs, no network, no LLM. Failsafe-permissive: a `{ detected:false, error }`
 * scope (or a missing/garbage scope) returns `{ emit:false, visual_gate:false }` and NEVER throws.
 * Mirrors flutter-ui-scope.cjs module style (node:test-driven, hand-built fixtures).
