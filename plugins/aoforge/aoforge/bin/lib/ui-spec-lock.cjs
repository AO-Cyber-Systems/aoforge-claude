/**
 * ui-spec-lock — the look-lock (objective 34-07).
 *
 *   shapeHash(spec)              sha256 hex of canonical({routes, controls, states}) — ONLY
 *   canonicalShapeJson(spec)     the exact bytes that hash digests, so a surprise can be READ
 *   writeLock(specPath, opts)    splice `acceptance:` into the spec's front matter
 *   lockStatus(spec)             'held' | 'cleared' | 'absent' | 'MISSING', with a reason
 *
 * ── The asymmetry this module exists to produce ──────────────────────────────
 * §4.1: "any change to `routes`, `controls` or `states` clears `acceptance.locked_sheet`."
 * Both halves are load-bearing and they fail in opposite directions:
 *
 *   * A lock that SURVIVES a shape change is a false approval. The file says a human looked
 *     at this surface; they looked at a different one.
 *   * A lock that DIES on a prose typo fix is unusable. The team re-approves without reading
 *     within a fortnight, and the file still says a human signed it off — strictly worse than
 *     no lock at all.
 *
 * So `locked_shape_hash` covers exactly three keys. Not `design_read` (a reworded design note
 * is not a new surface), not `flows` (a walk over structure already in the hash), not
 * `engine_version` (34-11's version bump would otherwise clear every lock in every repo for a
 * release that changed nothing a human looked at), and not the prose body — which is precisely
 * what §4.1 says must NOT clear a lock.
 *
 * ── ONE canonical serialiser, borrowed rather than re-derived ────────────────
 * `canonicalSheetJson`/`sheetHash` come from `ui-sheet.cjs`. 34-06 built ONE hashing path on
 * purpose: two definitions of what a human's approval covers eventually disagree about whether
 * it still stands. This module supplies a different PAYLOAD (three spec keys instead of the
 * sheet model) to the same recursive key-sorted serialiser and the same digest. A future change
 * to canonicalisation therefore moves `sheet_hash` and `locked_shape_hash` together, which is
 * the only way they can stay comparable.
 *
 * ── Why the section hashes are STORED, not recomputed ───────────────────────
 * `lock: cleared` has to name WHICH of the three changed, or the human is sent back to diff
 * the file by hand. That cannot be recomputed after the fact: telling routes-changed from
 * states-changed needs the per-section value AS AT THE LOCK. So `writeLock` stores
 * `locked_section_hashes: {routes, controls, states}` beside `locked_shape_hash`. A lock
 * written by hand (or by an older engine) that omits them still resolves held/cleared — the
 * reason then says the changed section cannot be named, rather than guessing one.
 *
 * ── Writing YAML back is the risky half ─────────────────────────────────────
 * yaml-lite parses; it does not serialise, and round-tripping the whole front matter through a
 * serialiser would reformat every line the author wrote. `spliceAcceptanceBlock` therefore
 * operates on the RAW TEXT: it finds the `acceptance:` block (or the end of the front matter)
 * and replaces exactly those lines. The prose body and every untouched front-matter line come
 * back byte-identical — case A2. A tool that silently reflows the artifact a human approved has
 * invalidated the approval in the act of recording it.
 *
 * Consumed by: ./ui-spec-cli.cjs (`ui lock`, and the `lock` field on `ui spec validate`).
 * Depends on: ./ui-spec.cjs, ./ui-spec-validate.cjs, ./ui-sheet.cjs. No npm dependencies.
