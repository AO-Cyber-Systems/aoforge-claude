/**
 * ui-spec-validate — the Surface Spec static invariants (objective 34-03 / 34-04).
 *
 *   validateSurfaceSpec(spec, {patterns, vocabulary})
 *       -> {ok, complete, unchecked, errors, engine_version, schema_version}
 *   exitCodeFor(verdict) -> 0 | 1 | 2   (EXIT.OK | EXIT.VIOLATION | EXIT.INCOMPLETE)
 *
 * One export does the work and it NEVER throws. The verdict is structured — an array of
 * `{code, path, msg}` — because 34-04's `aof-tools ui spec validate` arm turns `errors` into an
 * exit code and a thrown string turns that into a stack trace. `bin/lib/validate.cjs` is the
 * house precedent for the shape; the code SPACE is separate (`SPEC*`, `ROUTE*`, `CTRL*`,
 * `STATE*`, `PAT*`, `HIT*`, `FLOW*`, `GUARD*`), never `validate.cjs`'s `E`/`W`/`I` numbering.
 *
 * Shipped by 34-03:
 *   SPEC000  the input is not a readable spec object (null, a scalar, an empty front matter,
 *            or a yaml-lite parse failure — whose `.line` is carried into the message)
 *   SPEC001  the spec violates the declared STRUCTURE of surface-spec.schema.json
 *   SPEC002  `schema_version` is outside the engine's supported range (short-circuits)
 *   ROUTE001 `route.entry` is absent or empty
 *   ROUTE002 a route declares no `back` and is not `root: true`
 *   ROUTE003 an `entry: [{control: id}]` names a control this spec does not declare
 *   CTRL001  a control declares BOTH a top-level `does` and a `behaviors[]` list
 *   CTRL002  a control declares NEITHER
 *   CTRL003  two behaviours match the same observed combination (exclusivity)
 *   CTRL004  a combination is matched by no behaviour (coverage)
 *   CTRL005  an `effect` value outside the §7.5 effect classes
 *   CTRL006  `visible_in` names a state id absent from `states`
 *
 * Appended by 34-04 (I4-I8):
 *   STATE001 a state with no `seed`
 *   STATE002 outage.content.must_show INTERSECTS empty.content.must_show (disjoint, not
 *            merely unequal — the amended §4.4 / §4.5 I4)
 *   STATE003 §4.4's minimum state set is incomplete (ONE error listing every missing state)
 *   STATE004 the mandatory `narrow` state declares no `viewport` below NARROW_MAX_WIDTH
 *   STATE005 the mandatory `dark` state does not declare `theme: dark`
 *   PAT000   the pattern catalogue is UNREACHABLE -> status MISSING, does NOT flip `ok`
 *   PAT001   a referenced pattern is not in the catalogue
 *   PAT002   a control of a pattern kind drops one of that pattern's `must_not` defaults
 *   HIT000   the hit-rect invariant could not run -> status MISSING, does NOT flip `ok`
 *   HIT001   a `hit_rect.disjoint_from` entry that does not resolve, names its own control,
 *            or is not reciprocal
 *   HIT002   a `hit_rect.within` entry that does not resolve, or that ALSO appears in this
 *            control's `disjoint_from`
 *   FLOW001  a flow step names a control or route that does not exist (and that this
 *            single-spec engine was entitled to resolve — see `isNamespaceLocal`)
 *   FLOW002  a flow's last step is neither a `back` nor a route declared `root: true`
 *   GUARD001 a route guard that names no denied state (see `resolveGuardDeniedState`)
 *
 * ── `ok`, `complete`, and what a MISSING row means (read before 34-08's "refuse to compose") ─
 * `ok` counts REAL VIOLATIONS only. A `*000` code carries `status: 'MISSING'`: the check could
 * not run, so the answer is neither pass nor fail, the row is reported so nobody can miss it,
 * and it does NOT flip `ok`. W1b has no pinned eden-ui-flutter release, so EVERY real run
 * carries one PAT000 row — treating that as a failure would block composition on every surface
 * in the repo, and treating it as a pass is the silent-green class §2 goal 5 forbids. MISSING
 * rows sort after real violations, so `errors[0]` is always the most important thing wrong.
 *
 * That leaves `ok` answering one of the two questions a caller has, which is how issue #90
 * happened: `ok: true` with a PAT000 row exited 0, so `validate "$spec" || exit 1` read an
 * invariant that was never evaluated as verified — the row's own message says "§4.5 I5 is
 * UNCHECKED for this spec, which is not the same as passing", and the process said pass.
 *
 * So the verdict answers BOTH questions, side by side:
 *   `ok`        nothing VIOLATED an invariant.
 *   `complete`  every invariant actually RAN. False whenever any row is MISSING, and false for
 *               the short-circuit verdicts (SPEC000, SPEC002) where nothing ran at all.
 *   `unchecked` the codes of the checks that did not run, e.g. `['PAT000']`.
 *
 * and `exitCodeFor` turns the pair into 0 / 1 / 2. Neither field stands alone: a consumer
 * reading `ok` on its own is reading half an answer, and the exit code no longer lets it.
 *
 * Still reserved, and NOT implemented here: `CTRL007` (the `must_not` vocabulary). 34-03 left
 * it to 34-04; 34-04's own code list and fixture table stop at GUARD001, so it stays reserved
 * and `ctx.vocabulary` remains accepted-and-unused rather than being invented into a rule.
 *
 * ── The behaviour-coverage model (BINDING — 34-05's control table and W2's `effect` check
 *    resolve the active behaviour by this same rule; if they diverge, the spec says one thing
 *    and the probe asserts another) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §4.3 requires `behaviors[].when` clauses to be mutually exclusive and together cover every
 * `visible_in` state. `when` is a map over {control_state, viewport, theme, data_state, guard}.
 *
 *  1. A `when` key that is ABSENT is a WILDCARD. `{viewport: narrow}` matches every
 *     control_state, theme, data_state and guard.
 *  2. The domain of each dimension is CLOSED-WORLD, derived from the spec:
 *     - data_state    — the control's `visible_in` list.
 *     - viewport      — `narrow` when the state declares a `viewport` whose width is
 *                       < NARROW_MAX_WIDTH (600), or when the state's id is `narrow`;
 *                       otherwise `desktop`.
 *     - theme         — the state's `theme`, defaulting to `light`.
 *     - guard         — `denied` when the state is named as a route guard's denied state,
 *                       else `allowed`.
 *     - control_state — the union of every `control_state` value appearing in THIS control's
 *                       own `behaviors[].when`, plus every value in its `a11y.announces`.
 *                       If that union is empty, the dimension has the single value `default`.
 *  3. A behaviour MATCHES a combination when, for every key present in its `when`, the value
 *     equals the combination's value for that dimension.
 *  4. CTRL003 (exclusivity) fires when any combination is matched by two or more behaviours.
 *  5. CTRL004 (coverage)    fires when any combination is matched by zero behaviours.
 *
 * Worked against §4.2's `rail.project.header` — visible_in [populated, long-content, narrow],
 * control_state domain {collapsed, expanded}, six combinations, exactly one match on every row
 * (case I3g pins the table). Drop B3 -> the two `narrow` rows are uncovered -> CTRL004. Change
 * B3's `when` to `{control_state: collapsed}` -> it also matches rows 1 and 3 -> CTRL003.
 *
 * ── Three precedence rules, each written down because each is a decision ─────────────────────
 *
 *  a. SPEC002 SHORT-CIRCUITS. An engine that cannot read the spec's version has no basis for a
 *     verdict on its contents, so it reports the version and stops (the MISSING-not-pass rule
 *     applied to versions). Case I1c pins it.
 *  b. CTRL003 SHORT-CIRCUITS CTRL004 *within one control*. When two behaviours match the same
 *     combination the active behaviour is unresolvable, so a coverage verdict over that control
 *     has no basis; the CTRL003 message says so rather than leaving it silent.
 *  c. A SPECIFIC code beats the generic SPEC001 AT THE SAME PATH. The schema declares the
 *     `effect` enum and `route.entry`'s presence, and CTRL005/ROUTE001 own those same rules for
 *     a reader; reporting both would make every known-broken fixture fail with two codes and
 *     prove nothing about the invariant it is named for (proposal §17). One node, one verdict —
 *     the most specific one.
 *
 * And one deliberate NON-implementation: the schema's `minItems` is not checked. "At least one
 * declared way in" is ROUTE001's rule, and a rule with two homes is the drift objective 33
 * existed to close.
 *
 * Consumed by: 34-04 (the `aof-tools ui spec validate` arm), 34-05 (render), 34-06 (sheet).
 * Depends on: ./ui-spec.cjs (the schema + vocabulary LOADERS — never a second fs read of the
 * JSON) and ./helpers.cjs (`pluginVersion()`). No npm dependencies.

 * resolve, is not reciprocal, or names its own control · HIT002 a `within` entry that does not
 * resolve, or that also appears in this control's `disjoint_from`.
 *
 * ── The I6 decision, implemented here (recorded in 34-04-SUMMARY.md, resolved 2026-09-22,
 *    options (a) AND (b) together) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A Surface Spec carries hand-authored INTENT; geometry is the probe's job. §4.2 gives
 * `hit_rect` no coordinates, so there is no field from which a static overlap could be
 * computed — and inventing one would mean asserting a layout the spec never states. So:
 *
 *   * `hit_rect.within: <control-id>` IS part of the schema (option a) — the declarable form
 *     of the aodex#544 defect, where a 40x40 chevron's semantics node spanned the whole 360px
 *     row. `hit_rect.max: "WxH"` is an upper bound the PROBE asserts, not a layout instruction.
 *   * The static half is RESOLVABILITY + CONSISTENCY only (option b, which is cheap and
 *     correct under (a) as well): every `disjoint_from` entry resolves to a control in this
 *     spec, is reciprocal, and never names its own control; every `within` entry resolves and
 *     does not ALSO appear in that control's `disjoint_from` — a control cannot be both inside
 *     another's area and disjoint from it.
 *   * OVERLAP ITSELF IS NOT CHECKED HERE. W2's probe measures the rects: §7.5 `disjoint`
 *     ("rects of a `disjoint_from` pair overlap"), `hit-target`, and the new `within` row
 *     ("a control declaring `hit_rect.within` has a rect not contained by that control's, or
 *     exceeding a declared `max`"). This function is what that probe inherits.
 *
 * Two failure modes, two codes, two known-broken fixtures — `hit-rect-overlap.md` (HIT001) and
