# State Template

Template for `.aoforge/STATE.md` — the project's living memory.

---

## File Template

```markdown
# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .aoforge/PROJECT.md (updated [date])

**Core value:** [One-liner from PROJECT.md Core Value section]
**Current focus:** [Current objective name]

## Current Position

Objective: [X] of [Y] ([Objective name])
Job: [A] of [B] in current objective
Status: [Ready to plan / Planning / Ready to execute / In progress / Objective complete]
Last activity: [YYYY-MM-DD] — [What happened]

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

> Decisions and performance metrics are logged in STATE_ARCHIVE.md.

### Pending Todos

[From .aoforge/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

None yet.

## Session Continuity

Last session: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
Stopped at: [Description of last completed action]
Resume file: [Path to .continue-here*.md if exists, otherwise "None"]
```

<purpose>

STATE.md is the project's short-term memory spanning all objectives and sessions.

**Problem it solves:** Information is captured in summaries, issues, and decisions but not systematically consumed. Sessions start without context.

**Solution:** A single, small file that's:
- Read first in every workflow
- Updated after every significant action
- Contains digest of accumulated context
- Enables instant session restoration

</purpose>

<lifecycle>

**Creation:** After ROADMAP.md is created (during init)
- Reference PROJECT.md (read it for current context)
- Initialize empty accumulated context sections
- Set position to "Objective 1 ready to plan"

**Reading:** First step of every workflow
- progress: Present status to user
- plan: Inform planning decisions
- execute: Know current position
- transition: Know what's complete

**Writing:** After every significant action
- execute: After SUMMARY.md created
  - Update position (objective, job, status)
  - Add blockers/concerns
  - Decisions and metrics go to STATE_ARCHIVE.md (via aof-tools)
- transition: After objective marked complete
  - Update progress bar
  - Clear resolved blockers
  - Refresh Project Reference date

</lifecycle>

### Project Reference
Points to PROJECT.md for full context. Includes:
- Core value (the ONE thing that matters)
- Current focus (which objective)
- Last update date (triggers re-read if stale)

Claude reads PROJECT.md directly for requirements, constraints, and decisions.

### Current Position
Where we are right now:
- Objective X of Y — which objective
- Plan A of B — which plan within objective
- Status — current state
- Last activity — what happened most recently
- Progress bar — visual indicator of overall completion

Progress calculation: (completed jobs) / (total plans across all objectives) × 100%

### Accumulated Context

Decisions and performance metrics live in STATE_ARCHIVE.md to keep STATE.md lean.

**Pending Todos:** Ideas captured via /aoforge:todo add
- Count of pending todos
- Reference to .aoforge/todos/pending/
- Brief list if few, count if many (e.g., "5 pending todos — see /aoforge:todo list")

**Blockers/Concerns:** From "Next Objective Readiness" sections
- Issues that affect future work
- Prefix with originating objective
- Cleared when addressed

**Quick Tasks Completed:** From `/aoforge:quick` and `/aoforge:micro` — atomic-commit history. Both skills append to the same table. Differentiable by commit prefix: `chore(micro): ...` vs `docs(quick-NN): ...`.

### Session Continuity
Enables instant resumption:
- When was last session
- What was last completed
- Is there a .continue-here file to resume from

</sections>

<size_constraint>

Keep STATE.md under 100 lines.

It's a DIGEST, not an archive. Decisions and metrics live in STATE_ARCHIVE.md.
- Keep only active blockers, remove resolved ones

The goal is "read once, know where we are" — if it's too long, that fails.
