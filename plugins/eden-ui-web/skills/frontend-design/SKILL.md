<objective>
Build new web pages, review existing templates, or visually inspect rendered pages against the project's brand design system.

**Three modes:**

**Build mode** — Generate Hugo templates and partials using Tailwind CSS with the project's brand tokens. Compose from reusable partials rather than writing one-off HTML. Produces production-grade pages that match the brand design system (dark mode, responsive, accessible, performant).

**Review mode** — Audit existing Hugo templates for brand compliance. Check for: hardcoded colors instead of brand tokens, missing dark mode support, inconsistent typography, accessibility gaps, unused or redundant CSS, non-semantic HTML structure.

**Visual mode** — Load pages in a browser via Playwright and inspect the rendered output. Check visual consistency, responsive behavior, dark mode rendering, interactive functionality, and design token compliance in the actual DOM/CSS.

Output: Working Hugo templates (build), actionable findings with fixes (review), or visual audit report with screenshots (visual).

Mode + target: $ARGUMENTS
- `build <description>` — Generate new pages/partials (e.g., "build the pricing page")
- `review [paths]` — Audit existing files (e.g., "review layouts/partials/")
- `visual [URL]` — Visual browser inspection (e.g., "visual http://localhost:1313/about")
- If no mode specified, infer from context

**Brand reference — read at the start of every mode:**
- Brand config: `data/brand/config.toml`
- Brand CSS tokens: `assets/css/brand.css`
- Brand reference: `data/brand/reference.md` (if exists)

If no brand is configured, suggest running the `brand-builder` skill first.

**Hugo project structure (standard):**
- `layouts/` — Templates (baseof, list, single, partials, shortcodes)
- `content/` — Markdown content pages
- `assets/css/` — Tailwind source files
- `static/` — Static assets (images, fonts, favicons)
- `data/` — Data files (brand config, component data)
- `config/` or `hugo.toml` — Site configuration
</context>

<process>

## Build Mode

0. **Read project brand** — Load `data/brand/config.toml` and `assets/css/brand.css` to understand the active design tokens. If no brand exists, ask the user to run `brand-builder` first or specify a preset to apply inline. The brand determines all color, typography, and styling decisions.

1. **State the design read** — Before planning composition, write one line naming
   the surface kind, the audience, the visual language, and the foundation:
   *"Reading this as: a pricing page for procurement-minded B2B buyers, restrained
   editorial language, on the project's existing brand tokens with low motion."*

   Then set the three dials (EXPRESSION / MOTION / DENSITY) from the derivation
   table in `design-craft.md`. The brand is the outer boundary; the dials move
   inside it. If the objective's `work` type is `prototype` or `spike`, cap
   EXPRESSION and MOTION at 4 and spend the effort on whether it works.

   Ask at most **one** clarifying question, and only if the read genuinely
   diverges. If you can infer it, declare the read and proceed.

2. **Detect greenfield vs redesign** — If this page already exists in any
   form, stop and load `~/.claude/aoforge/references/design-redesign.md`. Misclassifying a
   redesign as a greenfield build is the largest single source of bad redesign
   work: it silently changes IA, slugs, nav labels and analytics identifiers.

   Audit before touching anything, read the *existing* surface's dials as your
   starting point rather than the table baseline, and treat the never-change list
   (URLs, nav labels, form field names, logo, legal copy) as
   `checkpoint:decision` material rather than something to guess.

3. **Understand the request** — What page/section/partial is needed? What content does it display? What user interactions does it support? Where does it fit in the site navigation?

4. **Check existing partials** — Read `layouts/partials/` to find reusable components already built for this project. Don't rebuild what exists — compose from existing partials.

5. **Plan the composition** — List which sections and components the page needs:
   - Page type (landing, content, blog, product, documentation)
   - Sections (hero, features, pricing, testimonials, CTA, footer)
   - Interactive elements (dark mode toggle, mobile nav, accordions, tabs)
   - Data sources (Hugo front matter, data files, content collections)

6. **Generate Hugo templates** — Write the template files:

   **Structure:**
   - Use `{{ define "main" }}...{{ end }}` blocks extending `baseof.html`
   - Create reusable partials in `layouts/partials/components/` for repeated patterns
   - Use Hugo's `partial` function with context: `{{ partial "components/hero.html" . }}`
   - Pass data via front matter and `.Params`

   **Styling with brand tokens:**
   - Use CSS custom properties from brand.css: `var(--brand-primary-500)`
   - Apply via Tailwind arbitrary values: `bg-[var(--brand-primary-500)]` or extend Tailwind config
   - Use `dark:` variants for all color-dependent styles
   - Follow the brand's border-radius, shadow, and spacing conventions

   **Responsive design:**
   - Mobile-first approach: base styles for mobile, `md:` for tablet, `lg:` for desktop
   - Hamburger menu for mobile navigation
   - Stack sections vertically on mobile, multi-column on desktop
   - Test at 375px, 768px, 1280px breakpoints

   **Accessibility:**
   - Semantic HTML: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`
   - ARIA labels on interactive elements
   - Skip-to-content link
   - Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skips)
   - Focus-visible styles on interactive elements
   - Alt text on all images

   **Performance:**
   - Use Hugo's image processing for responsive images: `{{ $img := resources.Get "..." }}`
   - Lazy-load below-fold images
   - Inline critical CSS if needed
   - Minimize JavaScript — use CSS for animations where possible

   **Interactivity (when needed):**
   - Dark mode toggle via JS (toggle `dark` class on `<html>`)
   - Mobile menu with Alpine.js or vanilla JS
   - Scroll-triggered animations via Intersection Observer
   - Canvas effects only if the brand calls for them (e.g., aocyber particle background)

7. **Verify** — Confirm all templates render without Hugo errors. Check that brand tokens are used consistently. Verify partials receive correct context.

8. **Run the pre-flight check** — Work every box in `design-preflight.md` before
   reporting the surface complete. It is a gate: a failure means fix and re-check,
   not note and ship. Items that need real rendering (both themes, the 320/768/1280
   breakpoints, evidence capture) must actually be rendered — reasoning about the
   markup is not checking. Use Visual mode below for that.

   Record the design read and the three dial values in the job's `SUMMARY.md`, so
   a later reviewer can tell whether restraint was a decision or an omission.

## Review Mode

0. **Read project brand** — Load brand config to understand what tokens should be in use.

1. **Discover target files** — Glob for `*.html` in `layouts/`. If no path given, scan all of `layouts/` and `assets/css/`.

2. **Audit each file** for these categories:

   **Brand compliance:**
   - Hardcoded colors (`bg-blue-500`, `#667eea`) instead of brand tokens
   - Non-brand fonts (inline font-family instead of brand variables)
   - Inconsistent spacing not matching brand scale
   - Shadows or border-radius not matching brand conventions

   **Generated-look tells** — work the full catalogue in `design-tells.md`, all seven categories. Highlights:
   - Three equal feature cards in a row; every section the same centred shape
   - Section-number eyebrows (`001 · Features`), decorative status dots, scroll cues
   - Grid lines or hairlines added as decoration rather than to organise content
   - Pure `#000`/`#fff`, full-saturation accents, neon glows, gradient display text
   - Oversized headings substituting for real hierarchy
   - Placeholder tells: "John Doe", "Acme", round numbers (`99.99%`, `10,000+`),
     repeated generic avatars, `div`-built fake screenshots, broken image `src`
   - Copy tells: filler verbs ("elevate", "seamless", "unleash"), poetic section
     labels, "Step 1 / Step 2", version stamps on marketing pages, em-dashes in
     interface strings
   - Motion tells: perpetual ambient animation, staggered entrance on every list
     item, scroll-jacking, no `prefers-reduced-motion` path

   **Hugo best practices:**
   - Templates not using `{{ partial }}` for repeated patterns
   - Missing `{{ with }}` / `{{ if }}` guards around optional data
   - Raw HTML in content files that should be shortcodes
   - Not using Hugo's asset pipeline (resources, fingerprinting)

   **Dark mode:**
   - Missing `dark:` variants on colored elements
   - White/light backgrounds without dark alternatives
   - Insufficient contrast in dark mode
   - Images or SVGs that don't adapt to dark backgrounds

   **Accessibility:**
   - Missing ARIA labels on buttons, links, interactive elements
   - Missing alt text on images
   - Non-semantic HTML (`<div>` where `<nav>`, `<section>` would be appropriate)
   - Missing skip-to-content link
   - Heading hierarchy violations

   **Performance:**
   - Unoptimized images (not using Hugo image processing)
   - Render-blocking scripts
   - Unused CSS classes
   - Missing lazy-loading on below-fold content

3. **Report findings** — Group by severity:
   - **Must fix** — Anything failing a floor in `design-craft.md` section 5:
     contrast, focus visibility, target size, reduced-motion path, semantics, alt
     text, horizontal scroll at 320px. Plus broken dark mode and hardcoded colors.
   - **Should fix** — Non-brand tokens, missing partials, Hugo anti-patterns, and
     generated-look tells that have no justification in the brief
   - **Consider** — Performance optimizations, additional semantic markup

   A tell is a finding only when nothing in the brief calls for it. Say which one
   applies rather than listing the pattern name on its own.

4. **Generate fixes** — Provide corrected code for must-fix and should-fix items. Apply fixes directly if approved.

## Visual Mode

Uses Playwright to load pages in a real browser and inspect rendered output.

### Setup

0. **Read project brand** — Load brand config to know what design to expect.

1. **Confirm the site is running** — Ask for the base URL (default: `http://localhost:1313`). Verify the Hugo dev server responds.

2. **Determine scope** — What pages to inspect:
   - Single URL: inspect one page
   - Section: all pages in a content section
   - Full audit: crawl from the homepage

### Page Inspection Sequence

For each page:

3. **Navigate and snapshot** — Load the URL. Take an accessibility snapshot to get the semantic structure — DOM tree, ARIA roles, heading hierarchy.

4. **Screenshot** — Capture the visual output for design review.

5. **Brand token audit** — Evaluate computed styles:
   ```js
   () => {
     const root = getComputedStyle(document.documentElement);
     return {
       primaryColor: root.getPropertyValue('--brand-primary-500'),
       fontDisplay: root.getPropertyValue('--brand-font-display'),
       darkMode: document.documentElement.classList.contains('dark'),
     };
   }
   ```
   Verify brand CSS variables are defined and applied correctly.

6. **Structure check** — From the accessibility snapshot:
   - Semantic landmarks present (header, nav, main, footer)
   - Heading hierarchy is correct
   - Interactive elements have labels
   - Focus order is logical
   - Skip-to-content link exists

7. **Responsive check** — Resize and re-inspect:
   - **Desktop** (1280x800)
   - **Tablet** (768x1024)
   - **Mobile** (375x812)

   At each breakpoint: screenshot, check snapshot for layout changes, verify nav adapts.

8. **Dark mode check** — Toggle dark mode:
   ```js
   () => { document.documentElement.classList.toggle('dark'); }
   ```
   Screenshot in dark mode. Verify:
   - No white backgrounds bleeding through
   - Text contrast is sufficient
   - Brand colors render correctly on dark surfaces
   - Images/SVGs adapt to dark backgrounds

9. **Interactive testing** — Test dynamic elements:
   - **Mobile nav:** Click hamburger → verify menu opens → close
   - **Dark mode toggle:** Click → verify theme switches
   - **Accordions/tabs:** Click items → verify content switches
   - **Scroll animations:** Scroll down → verify elements animate in
   - **Links:** Verify navigation works, no 404s

10. **Console check** — After interactions, check for:
    - JavaScript errors
    - Missing asset warnings (fonts, images)
    - CORS issues with external resources

### Reporting

11. **Compile visual audit report:**

    **Layout & Spacing:** Alignment issues, overflow, inconsistent margins

    **Brand Compliance:** Colors, fonts, shadows not matching brand tokens

    **Responsive:** Breakpoint-specific layout problems

    **Dark Mode:** Elements that break in dark mode

    **Accessibility:** Issues found in live DOM that code review missed

    **Performance:** Visible loading delays, layout shift, unoptimized images

12. **Cross-reference with code** — Trace each finding back to the responsible template file. Provide file paths and specific code to change. Offer to apply fixes.
