## Markers and caches

Rarely touched, but they explain otherwise-confusing behaviour.

| File | Written by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `.skill-active` | `aof-tools skill-active --start` | Its presence is what lets `gate-edits` allow edits. Carries `expires_at`, 8h default. |
| `.edit-override` | `route-intent` | Records an override phrase in your prompt. Single-turn, consumed by `gate-edits`. |
| `.gh-mapping.json` | `gh sync-objectives` | Objective number → GitHub issue number. **Commit this.** |
| `.migrate-backup-*/` | intent-model migration | Full backup taken before any migration writes |
