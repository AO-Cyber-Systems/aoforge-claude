# Objective 4 — Locked Context

This file captures user decisions that are **LOCKED** for the planner. Do not re-litigate. Do not propose alternatives. Implement exactly.

## Goal

Detect when a planned or about-to-execute objective overlaps with another session's in-flight or recently-shipped work; surface the overlap to the user with a 4-option resolution flow (**Merge / Defer / Coordinate / Proceed-anyway**). Consumes obj 2's peer scanner + obj 3's org-overlap output. Plan-time + execute-time checks; **no new storage backend**.

Two checkpoints:

1. **Plan-time** (`/df:plan-objective` entry, after researcher runs) — primary line of defense. Blocks on hard match (same `github_issue`) or strong match (≥2 file overlap or ≥3 keyword overlap). Surfaces 4-option AskUserQuestion. Logs all matches (advisory or blocking) to CONTEXT.md `## Coordination Note` section.
2. **Execute-time** (`/df:execute-objective` entry, before first wave) — friction-minimal. Re-runs the same comparison; **stricter than plan-time** (no advisory triggers a prompt — only blocking matches). If no blocking match: a one-line log entry, no prompt.

Both checkpoints share the same detection engine + 4-option resolution dispatcher.

## What's already built (obj 1 + obj 2 + obj 3 surface that obj 4 consumes)

Obj 4 is a **read-only consumer** of obj 1's GH primitives + obj 2's peer scanner + obj 3's org-overlap output. **DO NOT recreate any of these.**

### From `lib/gh.cjs` (obj 1 ship — feature/v1.1, merged via PR #21):

- `resolveChain(frontmatter, projectCtx)` — walks ONE objective's chain (parent_issue → roadmap → org_project). Obj 4's hard-match detection compares `current_github_issue` vs each peer's `github_issue` (from peer STATE.md).
- `requireGhAuth(requiredScopes)` — hard-fail auth check throwing `GhAuthError`. Obj 4 does NOT call this directly; it calls obj 3's `scanOrgOverlap` which already wraps it.
- `_setRunGh(fn)` — test injection hook (not directly used by obj 4 tests; only via obj 3 mocks).

### From `lib/awareness.cjs` (obj 2 ship — feature/v1.1-obj-2-heartbeat, merged via PR #23):

- `scanPeer(opts)` — git-branch state aggregation across `origin/*`. **Obj 4's primary input.** Returns `{ branches: [...], fetched_at, warnings, current_branch }` where each branch entry has `{ branch, objective, trd, github_issue, last_commit, developer }`. Files-touched is NOT in the peer scanner's output — only objective + TRD + github_issue. **Obj 4's file-overlap match works against `files_modified` in the peer's TRD frontmatter** (read via `_runFs.readFileSync`/parsed via `extractFrontmatter`), NOT against runtime telemetry.
- `parseStateMd(content)` — STATE.md parser. Obj 4 may extract `objective_complete` to detect recently-shipped work (≤30 days; treat as soft signal, do not block).
- `_setRunGit(fn)` — test injection hook used by obj 2's tests. Obj 4 stubs scanPeer via its own `_setRunPeer` injection — does NOT manipulate `_runGit`.
- `readCache(cwd)` — reads `.planning/.awareness-cache.json`. Obj 4 reads the `peer` namespace if present (saves a fresh git fetch); falls back to live `scanPeer` when cache is missing/stale.
- `isStale(fetched_at, ttl_minutes)` — staleness check. Obj 4 uses 10-min TTL (matches awareness default).

### From `lib/org-awareness.cjs` (obj 3 ship — feature/v1.1-obj-3-planning-awareness, in PR):

- `scanOrgOverlap(opts)` — graceful auth-degradation org-Project walker. **Obj 4's secondary input for hard-match detection** (top org-overlap items with `chain_match: true` are hard-match candidates). Returns `{ items: [], warnings, skipped: bool, misfiling: object|null }`. When `skipped: true` (no gh auth), obj 4 silently degrades — peer-only signals still detect duplicates.
- `_tokenize(text)` — locked tokenization helper. Obj 4 reuses for keyword-overlap match (≥3 shared keywords = strong match). **Do NOT re-implement.**
- `_setRunFs(fn)` — fs injection hook. Obj 4 introduces its own `_setRunPeer` + `_setRunOrgOverlap` higher-level mocks; the underlying `_runFs` is mocked transitively via obj 3's hook when needed.

### From `__fixtures__/awareness-fixtures.cjs`:

- All obj 2 + obj 3 builders (15+ entries; see obj 3's CONTEXT §"From `__fixtures__/awareness-fixtures.cjs`"). Obj 4 ADDS to this file — does NOT duplicate. New builders introduced in obj 4 (planned in 04-01):
  - `buildPeerBranch({ branch, objective, github_issue, files_modified, last_commit_iso })` — single peer-scanner branch entry shape.
  - `buildPeerScanResult({ branches: [], current_branch })` — wraps `branches` for `scanPeer()` mock returns.
  - `buildOrgOverlapMatch({ issue_ref, title, score, chain_match, matched_keywords })` — single `scanOrgOverlap.items[]` entry.
  - `buildDupDetectFixtures()` — combined helper that returns paired peer + org-overlap fixture for end-to-end detection tests.

## Locked decisions (from ROADMAP §"Objective 4: Duplicate-work detection + resolution flow")

### 1. Plan-time + execute-time checkpoints

- Plan-time: `/df:plan-objective` workflow runs `df-tools dup-detect --mode plan <objective_id>` AFTER researcher completes (CONTEXT.md exists + RESEARCH.md exists), BEFORE the planner agent spawns. Blocking match → AskUserQuestion (4 options). Advisory match → log to CONTEXT.md, continue.
- Execute-time: `/df:execute-objective` workflow runs `df-tools dup-detect --mode execute <objective_id>` BEFORE the first wave spawns. **Stricter than plan-time** (no advisory triggers a prompt; only blocking matches do).

Per `feedback_autopilot_after_setup` memory: the detector MUST NOT gate every plan/execute on confirmation. Only blocking matches surface a prompt. Weak matches print a one-line log.

### 2. Three signal classes (lexical, no LLM scoring)

| Signal | Match condition | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| **Hard match** | Same `github_issue` ref between current objective and a peer session OR an obj 3 org-overlap top match (`chain_match: true`) | block |
| **Strong match** | ≥2 file path overlap with a peer's `files_modified` (read from peer's TRD frontmatter via `extractFrontmatter`), OR ≥3 keyword overlap with a peer's objective title (tokenized via obj 3's `_tokenize`) | block |
| **Weak match** | 1-2 keyword overlap, or single shared file in different concerns | advise (log only; never blocks; **execute-time IGNORES advisory entirely**) |

**No LLM scoring, no semantic similarity, no embeddings.** Per ROADMAP "Out of scope: LLM-based semantic similarity — locked deterministic per obj 3 precedent." Hand-built lexical match: `github_issue` string equality + `files_modified` path-set intersection + `_tokenize` keyword-set intersection.

### 3. 4-option resolution flow

Presented via AskUserQuestion when blocking match found:

| Option | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Merge** | Abort current planning. Display: "This objective overlaps with `<peer_objective>` on `<peer_branch>`. Switch to that branch and continue there: `git checkout <peer_branch>`. Current objective directory left intact for manual cleanup." Exit workflow. |
| **Defer** | Save current planning state to `.planning/.deferred/<objective_id>.json` (see locked decision #6). Exit workflow. Resumption is OUT OF SCOPE for v1.1 — the JSON is just persistence. |
| **Coordinate** | Continue planning. Append `## Coordination Note` section to `.planning/objectives/<objective_dir>/<padded>-CONTEXT.md` naming the matched peer session + suggested handoff points. Planner reads this section transitively (it's already part of CONTEXT.md). |
| **Proceed-anyway** | Continue planning with full warning. Append `## Coordination Note` to CONTEXT.md (same as Coordinate) PLUS a `**WARNING:** User chose "Proceed anyway" despite blocking match — likely merge conflicts at commit time.` line. |

**4-option order is locked.** AskUserQuestion options are presented in the order: Merge, Defer, Coordinate, Proceed-anyway. The 1-letter shortcut convention from existing devflow skills is NOT applied (AskUserQuestion uses full labels).

### 4. No new storage backend

- Reads from obj 2's peer scanner + obj 2's `.planning/.awareness-cache.json` cache + obj 3's org-overlap output.
- No daemon, no separate registry, no new GitHub-side storage.
- The single new write target is `.planning/.deferred/<objective_id>.json` (Defer mode) and `.planning/.dup-detect-log.jsonl` (resolution log).
- `.planning/.deferred/` is **NOT gitignored** (it's user planning state, may be committed for cross-machine resume in v1.2). `.planning/.dup-detect-log.jsonl` IS gitignored (per locked decision #7).

### 5. Read-only at execute-time when no blocking match

Per `feedback_autopilot_after_setup`: friction-minimal. If recheck at execute-time finds no blocking match, NO prompt — just a one-line log entry to `.planning/.dup-detect-log.jsonl`:

```jsonl
{"timestamp":"2026-05-04T...","objective_id":"04","mode":"execute","blocking":false,"top_match":null,"resolution":"none"}
```

Execute-time advisory matches (weak) are NOT logged to the log file — only blocking matches and resolutions. **Plan-time** logs ALL matches (advisory + blocking) to CONTEXT.md (see locked decision #6); the JSONL log captures only resolutions.

### 6. Plan-time match → CONTEXT.md note (always)

When plan-time detection finds ANY match (advisory or blocking), the matched-session metadata gets recorded in `.planning/objectives/<objective_dir>/<padded>-CONTEXT.md` so downstream agents see the coordination context. Format:

```markdown
## Coordination Note

Detected duplicate-work signals at plan-time on `<timestamp>`:

- **Strength:** strong | hard | weak
- **Source:** peer (branch `<peer_branch>`) | org-overlap (`<issue_ref>`)
- **Peer objective:** `<peer_objective>`
- **Signal:** `<signal type>` (e.g., "≥2 file overlap: app/foo.ts, app/bar.ts" or "github_issue match: AO-Cyber-Systems/aodex#33")
- **User resolution:** Coordinate | Proceed-anyway

**Suggested handoff points:**
- (auto-generated based on signal type — e.g., "shared files; consider splitting <objective_dir> into a sub-task that depends on <peer_objective>")
```

When user picks Merge or Defer, NO Coordination Note is written (objective is being abandoned/paused). Section is appended (not replaced) — multiple plan-time runs accumulate notes.

### 7. Resolution log to .planning/.dup-detect-log.jsonl

Append-only JSONL (one record per line, no rotation). **Gitignored per locked decision** (must add `.planning/.dup-detect-log.jsonl` to `.gitignore` in TRD 04-02).

Record schema (locked):

```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 UTC",
  "objective_id": "04",
  "mode": "plan" | "execute",
  "blocking": true | false,
  "top_match": {
    "strength": "hard" | "strong" | "weak" | null,
    "peer": "branch-name | issue-ref | null",
    "score": number | null
  } | null,
  "resolution": "merge" | "defer" | "coordinate" | "proceed-anyway" | "none"
}
```

**No PII.** `developer` from peer STATE.md is NOT included in the log. Append-only — never rewritten. Used for future detector tuning analysis.

### 8. Hard fails on infrastructure errors are silent

If obj 2's awareness cache is corrupt, or obj 3's `scanOrgOverlap` returns `skipped: true`, or peer scanner throws — `dup-detect` logs a one-line warning + continues without blocking. **Plan-time consultation NEVER blocks on infrastructure.** Detection becomes "best-effort with degraded signals."

Specifically:

- `scanPeer` throws / returns empty: continue with org-only signals; log warning.
- `scanOrgOverlap.skipped: true` (gh auth missing): continue with peer-only signals; log warning.
- Both fail: NO matches detected, NO blocking; record `mode: "plan", blocking: false, resolution: "none", top_match: null` with warnings array.
- Corrupt `.planning/.awareness-cache.json`: `readCache` returns null already; falls through to live `scanPeer`. If live `scanPeer` also fails, see above.

## Module surface (locked, per ROADMAP SC-10)

After all v1.1 obj 4 TRDs land, `lib/dup-detect.cjs` exports:

```js
module.exports = {
  // Pure logic (TDD'd):
  detectDuplicates,                 // ({ objective, projectCtx, mode }) => { blocking, matches, advisory, warnings }
  formatDetectionMarkdown,          // (result, opts) => string  (markdown for AskUserQuestion display + Coordination Note)
  recordResolution,                 // ({ objective_id, mode, blocking, top_match, resolution, cwd }) => void  (jsonl append)
  applyResolution,                  // ({ resolution, objective_id, peer_branch, peer_objective, cwd, detection }) => void  (dispatcher: writes Coordination Note OR .deferred file OR exits)

  // Test hooks:
  _setRunPeer,                      // (fn) => void  // mocks awareness.scanPeer
  _setRunOrgOverlap,                // (fn) => void  // mocks org-awareness.scanOrgOverlap
  _setRunFs,                        // (fn) => void  // mocks fs reads (peer TRD files for files_modified)
  _resetMocks,                      // () => void

  // Internal helpers (exposed for tests):
  _readPeerFilesModified,           // (peer_branch, cwd) => string[]  (reads peer TRDs via git show)
  _detectHardMatch,                 // (current, peer) => { matched: bool, signal: string }
  _detectStrongMatch,               // (current, peer) => { matched: bool, signal: string }
  _detectWeakMatch,                 // (current, peer) => { matched: bool, signal: string }
  _writeCoordinationNote,           // (objective_dir, padded, note_data) => void
  _writeDeferredState,              // (objective_id, state, cwd) => void

  // Constants:
  HARD_MATCH_THRESHOLD,             // 1 (any github_issue match)
  STRONG_FILE_OVERLAP_THRESHOLD,    // 2
  STRONG_KEYWORD_OVERLAP_THRESHOLD, // 3
  DUP_DETECT_LOG_REL,               // '.planning/.dup-detect-log.jsonl'
  DEFERRED_DIR_REL,                 // '.planning/.deferred'
};
```

`lib/gh.cjs`, `lib/awareness.cjs`, `lib/org-awareness.cjs` add **NO new exports** for obj 4 — obj 4 is purely a consumer.

## CLI surface (locked)

`df-tools dup-detect`:

- `df-tools dup-detect --mode plan <objective_id> [--raw]` — runs `detectDuplicates({ mode: 'plan' })`, emits structured JSON. Used by `/df:plan-objective` skill.
- `df-tools dup-detect --mode execute <objective_id> [--raw]` — runs `detectDuplicates({ mode: 'execute' })`, emits structured JSON. Used by `/df:execute-objective` skill. **Stricter** — only emits `blocking: true` results; advisory matches are filtered out.
- `df-tools dup-detect resolve <objective_id> --resolution <merge|defer|coordinate|proceed-anyway> --peer-branch <name> --peer-objective <id> [--cwd <path>]` — applies a resolution + records to JSONL. Used by `/df:plan-objective` skill after AskUserQuestion returns.
- `df-tools dup-detect log <objective_id> --mode <plan|execute> [--blocking <true|false>] [--top-match-json <json>] [--resolution <none|merge|defer|coordinate|proceed-anyway>]` — direct JSONL append (used by execute-time no-match log entry).

The new `df-tools dup-detect` subcommand router lives in `lib/dup-detect-cli.cjs` (mirror obj 3's `org-awareness-cli.cjs` pattern). Wired into `df-tools.cjs` via a single `case 'dup-detect':` arm in TRD 04-01.

## Mode differences (plan-time vs execute-time) — locked

| Behavior | Plan-time | Execute-time |
|---|---|---|
| Triggered by | `/df:plan-objective` after researcher completes, before planner spawns | `/df:execute-objective` before first wave spawns |
| Detection signals consumed | Hard + Strong + Weak | Hard + Strong (Weak filtered out before AskUserQuestion) |
| Blocking match → | AskUserQuestion (4 options) | AskUserQuestion (4 options) |
| Advisory match → | Logged to CONTEXT.md `## Coordination Note` (one-line entry); planner sees it transitively | NOT logged anywhere; silent skip |
| No match → | Log to JSONL `{ blocking: false, resolution: "none" }` | Log to JSONL `{ blocking: false, resolution: "none" }` |
| User resolution → | Per locked decision #3 (Merge / Defer / Coordinate / Proceed-anyway) | Same 4 options; same dispatcher |

**Critical:** plan-time CONTEXT.md note is the ONLY persistent advisory artifact. Execute-time is read-only when nothing blocks.

## Defer-state schema (locked, per ROADMAP SC-8)

`.planning/.deferred/<objective_id>.json`:

```json
{
  "objective_id": "04",
  "deferred_at": "ISO-8601 UTC",
  "mode": "plan" | "execute",
  "objective_dir": ".planning/objectives/04-duplicate-work-detection",
  "trd_count_at_defer": 0,
  "last_commit_at_defer": "abc1234" | null,
  "blocking_match": {
    "strength": "hard" | "strong",
    "source": "peer" | "org-overlap",
    "peer_objective": "<id>",
    "peer_branch": "<branch>" | null,
    "signal": "<signal description>",
    "score": <number>
  },
  "resolution_timestamp": "ISO-8601 UTC"
}
```

**No resumption command in v1.1** — just persist. Resumption is v1.2 polish.

`.planning/.deferred/` directory is created lazily by `_writeDeferredState` (does NOT need pre-creation).

## Detection engine (locked, per ROADMAP SC-1, SC-2, SC-3, SC-4)

`detectDuplicates({ objective, projectCtx, mode, cwd, peer_scan?, org_overlap?, current_files_modified?, current_keywords?, current_github_issue? })`:

1. **Resolve current objective state:**
   - `current_github_issue` — from `objective.frontmatter.github_issue` (OBJECTIVE.md) OR resolved via obj 1's `resolveChain`
   - `current_files_modified` — union of `files_modified` arrays from all TRDs in `objective_dir/*-TRD.md` (read via `_runFs.readFileSync` + `extractFrontmatter`); empty array if no TRDs yet (plan-time first run)
   - `current_keywords` — `_tokenize(objective.title || objective_id)` reusing obj 3's tokenizer
2. **Fetch peer scan** (via injected `_runPeer` mock or live `awareness.scanPeer({ no_fetch: false })`):
   - For each peer branch: extract `peer.github_issue`, read peer's TRDs via `_readPeerFilesModified(peer.branch, cwd)` (uses `git show <branch>:.planning/objectives/*/...-TRD.md` then `extractFrontmatter`), tokenize peer.objective title.
3. **Fetch org-overlap** (via injected `_runOrgOverlap` mock or live `org_awareness.scanOrgOverlap({ objective_id, current_tokens, sibling_repos: [], frontmatter, projectCtx })`):
   - If `skipped: true`: warning + continue with peer-only signals.
   - Else for each `items[]` with `chain_match: true`: candidate hard match.
4. **Detect matches** (per signal class):
   - Hard: `current_github_issue === peer.github_issue` OR org item with `chain_match` AND issue_ref equality.
   - Strong: |current_files_modified ∩ peer_files_modified| >= 2 OR |current_keywords ∩ peer_keywords| >= 3.
   - Weak: 1-2 keyword overlap OR single shared file.
5. **Aggregate result:**
   ```js
   {
     blocking: bool,           // true if any hard or strong match
     matches: [...],            // hard + strong
     advisory: [...],           // weak (filtered out in execute-time)
     warnings: [...],           // infrastructure failures
     mode,                      // 'plan' | 'execute'
     timestamp: <ISO>,
   }
   ```
   Per locked decision #5: in `mode: 'execute'`, advisory array is always empty (filtered at result construction time).

**Peer files_modified via git show:** `_readPeerFilesModified(branch, cwd)` runs `git show <branch>:.planning/objectives/<dir>/<file>-TRD.md` for each TRD file the peer's objective contains. Branches that haven't pushed TRDs yet (plan-time peer with no TRDs) → empty files_modified, only keyword-overlap can match.

## File-region ownership for `lib/dup-detect.cjs`

`lib/dup-detect.cjs` is **created in TRD 04-01** and **EXTENDED across waves**. Each TRD owns a documented region; wave sequencing prevents merge conflicts. **No two TRDs touching `lib/dup-detect.cjs` run in the same wave** (per `feedback_planner_proto_conflict` memory).

Region ownership (locked):

| Region | Owner TRD | Wave |
|---|---|---|
| Module skeleton (header, requires, constants, `_setRunPeer`/`_setRunOrgOverlap`/`_setRunFs` hooks, `detectDuplicates`, `_detectHardMatch`/`_detectStrongMatch`/`_detectWeakMatch`, `_readPeerFilesModified`) | 04-01 | 1 |
| `recordResolution` + `applyResolution` + `_writeCoordinationNote` + `_writeDeferredState` | 04-02 | 2 |
| `formatDetectionMarkdown` (pure formatter for AskUserQuestion display + CONTEXT.md note) | 04-03 | 3 |
| `module.exports` block (final lock) | 04-06 | 5 |

TRDs 04-01, 04-02, 04-03 each end their wave with a partial `module.exports` containing ONLY the symbols they introduced. TRD 04-06 finalizes the export surface (asserts all expected exports present via `Object.keys().sort()` deepStrictEqual).

## Wave structure (LOCKED)

Per `feedback_planner_proto_conflict` memory: planner under-encodes file-level co-modification. The orchestrator MUST sequence TRDs touching the same file even when `depends_on=[]` would suggest parallelism.

`lib/dup-detect.cjs` is touched by 4 TRDs (04-01, 04-02, 04-03, 04-06). Two skill TRDs (04-04, 04-05) touch non-overlapping skill workflow files (plan-objective.md vs execute-objective.md) and run parallel.

| Wave | TRD | Files touched | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 04-01 | dup-detect.cjs (skeleton + detectDuplicates + signal helpers + _readPeerFilesModified), dup-detect.test.cjs (NEW), dup-detect-cli.cjs (NEW), awareness-fixtures.cjs (extend), df-tools.cjs (case 'dup-detect') | Foundation: detection engine + fixtures + CLI router |
| 2 | 04-02 | dup-detect.cjs (recordResolution + applyResolution region), dup-detect.test.cjs, .gitignore (add .dup-detect-log.jsonl) | Resolution recorder + dispatcher + Defer/Coordinate/Proceed-anyway file writes; solo |
| 3 | 04-03 | dup-detect.cjs (formatDetectionMarkdown region), dup-detect.test.cjs | Markdown renderer for AskUserQuestion + CONTEXT.md note; solo |
| 4 | 04-04 + 04-05 | plan-objective.md (workflow), execute-objective.md (workflow); separate files PARALLEL | Skill integrations; non-overlapping workflow files |
| 5 | 04-06 | dup-detect.cjs (export lock), dup-detect.test.cjs (integration tests covering all 4 resolution paths) | Final integration |

**Why 5 waves?** Four TRDs touch `lib/dup-detect.cjs` and the two skill TRDs touch non-overlapping workflow files (plan-objective.md vs execute-objective.md), so they parallelize in Wave 4. Total objective execution time is dominated by the file-conflict serialization.

## TRD types (locked, not auto-derived)

Per the user's CLAUDE.md TDD Playbook directives: code-shipping work is TDD by default. Skill workflow markdown is standard.

| TRD | Type | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 04-01 — Detection engine + fixtures + CLI scaffold | `tdd` | Pure parser+matcher logic; testable with hand-built peer+org fixtures (`_setRunPeer` + `_setRunOrgOverlap` + `_setRunFs` injection). Fixture-builder task ahead of first behavior test. |
| 04-02 — Resolution recorder + applyResolution dispatcher | `tdd` | Pure logic + jsonl append + Defer/Coordinate file writes; tested against tmpdir fixtures. |
| 04-03 — formatDetectionMarkdown renderer | `tdd` | Pure formatter; trivial fixture inputs → asserted markdown output. |
| 04-04 — plan-objective workflow integration | `standard` | workflow markdown edit; calls `df-tools dup-detect --mode plan` + AskUserQuestion + dispatches resolution. Tested transitively via 04-06 integration test. |
| 04-05 — execute-objective workflow integration | `standard` | workflow markdown edit; calls `df-tools dup-detect --mode execute` + AskUserQuestion + dispatches resolution (or silent log). Tested transitively via 04-06. |
| 04-06 — Library export lock + e2e integration tests covering all 4 resolution paths | `tdd` | Export surface integration test (deepStrictEqual on Object.keys); end-to-end tests covering Merge/Defer/Coordinate/Proceed-anyway via simulated AskUserQuestion responses. |

## Anti-pattern constraints (honored across all TDD TRDs)

From the resolver's defaults table + project memory + `<tdd_playbook_directives>` from the orchestrator briefing:

- `no_llm_test_data` — All test fixtures must be hand-built factory functions (`__fixtures__/awareness-fixtures.cjs` extensions) or recorded cassettes. NO AI-generated sample data.
- `no_property_based_default` — Suppress property-based testing recommendations. Tests use enumerated cases.
- `no_gherkin_layer` — No Gherkin/BDD syntax. Use descriptive test names directly.
- **No LLM-based scoring.** Lexical match heuristic per locked decision #2. NO embeddings, NO semantic similarity, NO LLM calls in detection engine.
- **Multitenancy guard NOT applicable** — single-user CLI tool, single-org context (AO-Cyber-Systems). No tenant-isolation assertions required.
- **Outside-in NOT applicable** — pure-logic detector + skill-workflow edits; no UI/portal flows.

## TDD discipline for tdd-typed TRDs (apply to 04-01, 04-02, 04-03, 04-06)

Per CLAUDE.md TDD Playbook + orchestrator's `<tdd_playbook_directives>`:

- **Test list first**: include a `## Test list` section in TRD body listing behavior cases (happy + edge + failure) BEFORE any test code is written.
- **Fixture builders as their own task** ahead of the first behavior test. Hand-built factory functions in `plugins/devflow/devflow/bin/lib/__fixtures__/awareness-fixtures.cjs` (extending obj 2+3's file). NO `faker`, NO LLM-completed sample data.
- **Filesystem fixtures via tmp dirs**: TRD 04-02 needs tmpdir fixtures for `.planning/.deferred/` writes + `.planning/.dup-detect-log.jsonl` append; TRD 04-06 needs full repo-shaped tmpdir for end-to-end resolution paths.
- **One test at a time** RED → GREEN → REFACTOR. No batching.
- **Atomic commits per TDD TRD**: 2-3 commits (`test:` → `feat:` → optional `refactor:`).

## Discretion areas (planner / executor decides)

- Sub-task granularity within each TRD (within the 2-3 task budget).
- Specific signal-detection helper organization (so long as the public `detectDuplicates` contract holds).
- Whether `_readPeerFilesModified` reads via `git show` (preferred per CONTEXT.md) or via `_runFs` for tests; production code SHOULD use `git show` since peer TRDs live on origin/* branches not the local checkout.
- Whether `applyResolution` for Merge mode prints the suggested `git checkout` command or actually executes it (recommend: PRINT only, do not execute — user runs the checkout manually after reviewing).
- Test runner organization: append to single `dup-detect.test.cjs` (mirror `org-awareness.test.cjs` style — single file per module).
- Whether to add an `awareness.dup_detect_advisory_only` config flag for users who want to disable blocking (recommend: NO for v1.1, defer to v1.2; advisory-only is achievable today by always picking "Proceed anyway").

## Out of scope for v1.1 (planner must NOT include)

- Resumable defer mode — state persisted but no `df:resume-deferred` command in v1.1.
- Cross-org dup detection — only walks current org's awareness data (peer scanner is local-repo-scoped per obj 2 decision #6).
- LLM-based semantic similarity — locked deterministic per obj 3 precedent.
- Auto-merge of objective directories when user picks Merge — just abort + redirect; manual merge is user's job.
- Real-time notifications when a sibling starts overlapping work mid-execute — scoped to entry-point checks.
- Detector tuning UI / dashboard for log analysis — log is captured for FUTURE analysis; analysis tooling is separate work.
- A `--no-dup-detect` skip flag — escape hatch is "Proceed anyway" + log the override.
- Wiring the existing `awareness_refresh: true` flag from obj 2 TRD 02-06 into the `awareness` cache regen — that's obj 4's responsibility ONLY in the sense that it CONSUMES a possibly-fresh cache; refresh wiring stays inside the awareness skill, not dup-detect.

## Goal-backward verification

Every TRD MUST include `must_haves` mapping to the 10 success criteria below (reproduced from ROADMAP §"Objective 4"). Each requirement ID (SC-1 through SC-10) MUST appear in at least one TRD's `requirements` frontmatter field.

1. **SC-1**: `lib/dup-detect.cjs` exports `detectDuplicates({ objective, projectCtx, mode: 'plan' | 'execute' })` returning `{ blocking: bool, matches: [{strength, source, peer_objective, peer_branch, signal, score}], advisory: [...] }`. Hand-built fixtures; `_setRunPeer` + `_setRunOrgOverlap` injection mirrors obj 1+2+3 patterns.
2. **SC-2**: Hard match (same `github_issue` ref) is detected from peer scanner output AND from obj 3's `scan-org-overlap` output; both paths covered.
3. **SC-3**: Strong file-overlap matching: lexical comparison of current objective's `files_modified` (from OBJECTIVE.md or TRD frontmatter) against each peer's `files_modified` (from peer STATE.md / peer TRDs); ≥2 path overlap = strong; tested with realistic paths.
4. **SC-4**: Weak match logging — 1-keyword overlaps surface in `result.advisory` but not `result.blocking`.
5. **SC-5**: `/df:plan-objective` workflow runs `df-tools dup-detect --mode plan <objective_id>` after researcher completes. If `blocking: true`, surface AskUserQuestion with 4 options (Merge / Defer / Coordinate / Proceed-anyway). User's choice routes the workflow accordingly.
6. **SC-6**: CONTEXT.md gets a `## Coordination Note` section when match resolved as Coordinate or Proceed-anyway, naming the peer objective + branch + suggested handoff.
7. **SC-7**: `/df:execute-objective` workflow runs `df-tools dup-detect --mode execute <objective_id>` before first wave. Stricter (no advisory-only — only blocking signals trigger prompt). Same 4-option resolution.
8. **SC-8**: Defer mode persists state to `.planning/.deferred/<objective_id>.json` with: objective metadata, current TRD count, last commit, resolution timestamp. Resumable via separate command (deferred state out of obj 4 scope; just persist).
9. **SC-9**: `.planning/.dup-detect-log.jsonl` (gitignored) records each detection with `{ timestamp, objective_id, mode, blocking, top_match: {strength, peer, score}, resolution }`. Append-only; no rotation.
10. **SC-10**: `lib/dup-detect.cjs` surface lock: `detectDuplicates`, `formatDetectionMarkdown`, `recordResolution`, `applyResolution`, `_setRunPeer`, `_setRunOrgOverlap`. Module exports stable surface; integration test covers all 4 resolution paths.
