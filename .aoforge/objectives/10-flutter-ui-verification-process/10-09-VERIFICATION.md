# TRD 10-09 Verification Report — `df-tools flutter-ui setup`

**Verified:** 2026-05-25
**Scope:** TRD 10-09 only (parent objective 10 verified 2026-05-25 at 8/8 — see `10-VERIFICATION.md`)
**Status:** passed

## Goal Achievement

| #  | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------|--------|----------|
| 1  | `flutter-ui setup` subcommand reachable without "Unknown command" | ✓ VERIFIED | `df-tools.cjs:419-430` routes `case 'flutter-ui'`; smoke run starts with `{` not `Unknown` (`head -c 1` → `{`) |
| 2  | Missing-tool detection + empty plan when all present | ✓ VERIFIED | `flutter-ui-setup.cjs:40-51` preserves input order; tests Case 1 (`test.cjs:123-130`) + Case 2 (`test.cjs:132-136`) pass; smoke run reported `missing:["chromedriver"]` correctly |
| 3  | Platform-aware plan: darwin `brew install`, linux `apt-get install` | ✓ VERIFIED | `flutter-ui-setup.cjs:77-88` branches on `process.platform`; Cases 3/3b/4 (`test.cjs:142-161`) pass; chromedriver special-cased with `--cask` per gotcha |
| 4  | Daemon live → handoff records valid against `validateInputsSchema` | ✓ VERIFIED | `flutter-ui-setup.cjs:107-132` writes `{id, cmd, cwd, status, created_at}` records; Case 5 (`test.cjs:211-243`) confirms `validateInputsSchema({secrets:[]}).ok === true` for each emitted record |
| 5  | Daemon down → prints commands to stdout + exits non-zero | ✓ VERIFIED | `flutter-ui-setup.cjs:204-216` emits per-line commands then `process.exit(plan.length ? 1 : 0)`; Case 6 (`test.cjs:373-388`) asserts exit=1 + install-line regex; smoke run also exited 1 |
| 6  | Chains into `flutter-ui-bootstrap.checkBootstrapState` + forwards result | ✓ VERIFIED | `flutter-ui-setup.cjs:229-233` calls `checkBootstrapState({projectDir: cwd})` and merges into `bootstrap` field; Case 7 (`test.cjs:285-313`) does `deepStrictEqual(payload.bootstrap, expectedBootstrap)` |
| 7  | Idempotency: marker + tools present → `status:'already-set-up'` + zero handoff records | ✓ VERIFIED | `flutter-ui-setup.cjs:173-190` short-circuits before any dispatch; Case 8 (`test.cjs:249-283`) asserts `"status":"already-set-up"` in stdout AND `records.length === 0` |
| 8  | `--print-only` forces print path regardless of daemon state | ✓ VERIFIED | `flutter-ui-setup.cjs:204` `if (flags.print_only || !daemonLive)`; Case 9 (`test.cjs:315-347`) confirms live pid file + `--print-only` writes zero handoff records |
| 9  | `--auto` flag suppresses prompts (forward-compat no-op) | ✓ VERIFIED | `flutter-ui-setup.cjs:256-262` parses flag, echo'd in output; Case 10 (`test.cjs:349-371`) closes stdin, asserts no timeout + `payload.flags.auto === true` |
| 10 | Hand-built fixtures only — no LLM-generated test data, no property-based, no Gherkin | ✓ VERIFIED | `test.cjs:40-117` fixtures take explicit object/boolean specs; grep for `fast-check\|jsverify\|cucumber\|.feature\|Math.random` returns zero hits; IDs asserted via regex not literal |

**Score:** 10/10 truths verified

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|----|----|--------|

## Requirements Coverage

TRD 10-09 declares `requirements: []` — purely additive adoption ergonomics with no formal requirement IDs from `REQUIREMENTS.md`. No coverage gaps to track.

## Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Notes |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| `flutter-ui-setup.cjs` | 33 | `TODO note below if/when we extend` (in JSDoc) | ℹ Info | Doc-comment forward-looking note about extending `detectMissingTools` to multi-dir PATH; not a stub — `detectMissingAcrossPath` at `:241-254` already implements the multi-PATH probe used by `cmdFlutterUISetup`. |
| `flutter-ui-setup.cjs` | 73 | `return []` | ℹ Info (not a stub) | Canonical empty-input early-return inside `buildInstallPlan`; correct branch, not a placeholder. |

No `FIXME`, no `placeholder`, no LLM-generated test data, no property-based libraries (`fast-check`/`jsverify`), no Gherkin/`.feature` files. Zero blockers, zero warnings.

## Summary

TRD 10-09 delivers the one-command adoption promise. `df-tools flutter-ui setup` detects missing tools across the live `$PATH`, emits a platform-aware install plan, dispatches via handoff when the daemon is live (with `validateInputsSchema`-compatible record shape) or prints copy-pasteable commands with a non-zero exit when it isn't, chains transparently into the existing bootstrap detector, and short-circuits idempotently on already-set-up projects. Test suite (12/12 passing, hand-built fixtures throughout) covers every must_have plus the chromedriver `--cask` gotcha. Implementation is tight (~280 LOC), correctly scoped (no auto-install side effects, no Windows path, no marker writes), and the `--print-only`/`--auto` flags behave per spec. Ready to ship.

## Post-Verification Correction (2026-05-25 dogfood)

A live dogfood run against `eden-libs/eden-ui-flutter/` revealed that the TRD originally listed `gh` (GitHub CLI) instead of `maestro` in `DEFAULT_REQUIRED_TOOLS`. The planner pattern-matched on devflow's existing handoff-watcher docs (where `gh auth login` is the canonical interactive-auth example) and substituted `gh` where `maestro` belonged for Flutter UI verification adoption.

**Root cause:** Original planner prompt named `jq` as the example tool but did not enumerate the canonical 3-tool list (jq + chromedriver + maestro). All 12 original tests passed against the wrong list because hand-built fixtures use whatever tool names the test says, masking the substantive error.

**Fix (3 commits on this branch after initial verification):**
- `45262be` `test(10-09): swap gh→maestro, expect curl installer (RED)` — added Cases 1c, 3c, 4c; rewrote Cases 1/2/3/4 to use maestro; 4 failing tests at RED
- `15b229c` `feat(10-09): swap gh→maestro, add curl installer for maestro (GREEN)` — `DEFAULT_REQUIRED_TOOLS = ['jq', 'maestro', 'chromedriver']`; `formatInstallCommand` special-cases maestro to `curl -fsSL "https://get.maestro.dev" | bash` on both darwin + linux (maestro has no brew formula or apt package); `cmdFlutterUISetup` now sources from `DEFAULT_REQUIRED_TOOLS` instead of a duplicated literal
- (this docs commit follows) — TRD truths/test_list + this correction note

**Re-verification:** 15/15 tests pass after fix. Live dogfood from `eden-libs/eden-ui-flutter/` now correctly emits:
```
$ node ~/.../df-tools.cjs flutter-ui setup --print-only
curl -fsSL "https://get.maestro.dev" | bash
brew install --cask chromedriver
EXIT=1
```

**Workflow impediment flagged:** The planner-prompt-to-TRD path should enumerate the canonical tool list explicitly when scope mentions specific tools; relying on the planner to infer from one example is a foot-gun. Hand-built test fixtures do NOT catch this class of error because the fixture parameter IS the source of truth being tested.

`status:` remains `passed` (10/10 must-haves verified against the CORRECTED implementation). The original 10/10 verification was structurally correct against the TRD-as-written but the TRD itself encoded the wrong tool list.

## Second Correction (2026-05-25, same dogfood session)

After the maestro-tool fix, end-to-end dogfood surfaced two more TRD-encoded bugs:

**Bug A: Wrong Maestro installer URL.** TRD truth #6 + test cases said `https://get.maestro.dev` — DNS doesn't resolve. Correct URL per Maestro docs is `https://get.maestro.mobile.dev`.

**Bug B: Bootstrap chain skipped in the common adoption case.** Original `cmdFlutterUISetup` flow:
```
if (flags.print_only || !daemonLive) { print/exit BEFORE bootstrap }
```
This conflated "no daemon" with "skip bootstrap" — wrong, because bootstrap (`checkBootstrapState`) is a pure detector + setup_task emitter that does NOT need the daemon. The common adoption case (user already has the tools, daemon not running) hit this branch and exited 0 WITHOUT scaffolding the target project.

**Fix (4 commits on this branch after first correction):**
- `4d5c932` `test(10-09): expect get.maestro.mobile.dev (correct URL) (RED)` — 2 failing tests (Case 3c + 4c URL expectation)
- `376a6bb` `feat(10-09): correct maestro installer URL to get.maestro.mobile.dev (GREEN)` — single-line URL change in `formatInstallCommand`
- `866ac14` `test(10-09): add Case 11 — bootstrap-chain runs when tools present + no daemon (RED)` — new test asserting `payload.bootstrap` present in no-daemon-tools-present case
- `b92fe3c` `feat(10-09): chain bootstrap when tools present regardless of daemon state (GREEN)` — restructured cmdFlutterUISetup into 4 explicit branches: print-only (no side-effects), no-daemon+missing-tools (print+exit 1, no bootstrap), daemon-live (dispatch if needed) + bootstrap chain ALWAYS when reachable

**Re-verification:** 16/16 tests pass after fix (added Case 11). Live dogfood from `eden-libs/eden-ui-flutter/` with all tools present + no daemon now correctly returns:
```json
{
  "status": "tools-ready",
  "missing": [],
  "plan": [],
  "bootstrap": {
    "ready": false,
    "missing": ["integration_test_dep", "integration_test_dir", "maestro_dir"],
    "action": "warn",
    "setup_task": "<task ...>...full XML setup_task block...</task>"
  }
}
```
EXIT=0. The setup_task is now surfaced for the executor to apply, fulfilling the one-command adoption promise.

**Cumulative TRD 10-09 patch history: 3 bugs found via dogfood, 3 fixed.** Pattern across all 3: planner-generated TRD test_list encoded specific values (`gh` instead of `maestro`, `get.maestro.dev` instead of `get.maestro.mobile.dev`, `if !daemonLive` instead of `if !daemonLive && plan.length > 0`) that the executor faithfully implemented, and the hand-built fixture tests validated those values rather than the underlying intent. The end-to-end dogfood was the only surface that caught all three.

**Workflow impediment (consolidated, for devflow-claude backlog):**
1. Planner prompt enumerated 1 example tool — planner backfilled the rest. **Recommendation:** require planner prompts to either enumerate the canonical list OR explicitly mark the example as "name 1 of N, planner must research the rest."
2. URLs/version-pinned values not verified at plan time. **Recommendation:** planner should HTTP-HEAD verify URLs before encoding them in TRD test_list (cheap CLI step).
3. Conditional logic in TRDs not pressure-tested against the common-case state matrix. **Recommendation:** for any TRD with a conditional branch, planner must enumerate the cell matrix (e.g. `{daemon: live|down} × {plan: empty|non-empty}`) and write a truth + test per cell.

`status:` remains `passed` (10/10 must_haves + Case 11 verified). Original verification structurally correct against TRD-as-written; both corrections were TRD-encoding bugs.

## Third Correction (2026-05-25, same dogfood session — architecture gap)

After the maestro/URL/bootstrap-chain fixes, the user surfaced a **5th finding** — an architectural scope bug:

> "Maestro isn't for devflow it is on the repository that has flutter (so any UI repo)"

**Root cause:** TRD 10-09 had no Flutter-repo guard. `cmdFlutterUISetup` would happily install chromedriver/maestro/jq via the handoff watcher from ANY directory — pollution risk + wrong architecture. DevFlow's job is to *detect + scaffold + dispatch* when the consuming repo is verifiably a Flutter UI repo; the consuming repo (eden-ui-flutter, future UI verticals) owns its own toolchain install path.

**Fix (4 commits on this branch after second correction):**
- `f0f4a2e` `test(10-09): add Flutter-repo gate tests (Cases 12a-f detector + Case 13 CLI guard) (RED)` — 7 new RED tests for `detectFlutterRepo` (6 detector cases + 1 integration gate case)
- `49d66b4` `feat(10-09): add Flutter-repo gate; refuse non-Flutter cwd (GREEN)` — new `detectFlutterRepo(opts)` exported helper composing 4 checks (pubspec existence, `flutter: sdk: flutter` dep, `lib/` dir, environment.flutter version >= 3.16.0); gate wired as FIRST step in `cmdFlutterUISetup` returning `status:'not-a-flutter-project'` + `failures[]` + exit 1 when guard fails; `buildBootstrapTarget` fixture updated to always create Flutter shape so existing integration tests still pass

**Re-verification:** 23/23 tests pass after fix. Live dogfood:

```
$ cd /tmp && df-tools flutter-ui setup --raw
{"status":"not-a-flutter-project","cwd":"/private/tmp",
 "checks":{"pubspec":false,"flutterDep":false,"libDir":false,"minVersion":null},
 "failures":["no pubspec.yaml at /private/tmp/pubspec.yaml ...",
             "no 'lib/' directory at /private/tmp/lib ..."]}
EXIT=1

$ cd eden-libs/eden-ui-flutter && df-tools flutter-ui setup --raw
{"status":"already-set-up","bootstrap":{"ready":true,"action":"skip"}}
EXIT=0
```

**Why this is the deepest of the 5 dogfood findings:** The first 3 (gh→maestro, URL, daemon coupling) were value/logic bugs. This one is an **architectural scope bug** — the TRD's whole premise of "one-command adoption" didn't account for the cwd guard. The planner inferred "install Flutter tooling" as scope from the user-facing description without considering DevFlow's blast radius. Test fixtures couldn't catch this — they were never asked to assert "refuse to operate outside a Flutter repo" because the TRD never said so.

**Workflow impediment (4th item, for devflow-claude backlog):**
4. **Planner-prompt scope gating:** TRDs that operate on the user's filesystem must explicitly enumerate WHERE they're allowed to run, not just WHAT they do. Recommendation: planner prompt template should require a "this command is valid only when {cwd-shape conditions}" section, and the test_list must include at least one "command refuses to run when {valid cwd-shape} is absent" test per such TRD.

`status:` remains `passed` (10/10 must_haves + Case 11 + Cases 12a-f + Case 13 verified). All 5 dogfood findings are fixed atomically.
