# Changelog

All notable changes to DevFlow will be documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`df-tools stack verify [--run]`.** Checks that every command in the resolved profile can run:
  the binary is on PATH (or under GOPATH/bin, `~/.local/bin`, mise shims), the runner target
  exists, the script exists. Reports `resolved | binary_missing | target_missing | script_missing |
  unverifiable`. `--run` executes only safe keys (`format`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `build`; add
  `test`, `e2e`, `audit`, `sast` and the helm/docker lints with `--include`) and refuses anything
  that pushes, deploys, applies or uses port 8080, even inside a runner target's body.
- **`df-tools stack report [--write] [--draft]`.** Compares the repo's CI and local tooling with
  the profile (33 checks: missing lint/format/vuln gates, no race or coverage flags, CI-only gates
  with no local mirror, Flutter without Maestro) and writes `.planning/STACK-REPORT.md`. Proposals
  only; nothing is applied.
- **`df-tools stack mcp [--write]`.** Generates the project `.mcp.json` from each `agent_tooling.mcp`
  entry in the resolved profile (root plus components). Opt-in: it writes only managed entries
  (`env.DEVFLOW_MANAGED: "stack"`), keeps foreign entries and key order, and skips a server a plugin
  already declares or whose binary is missing. `stack init` and `upgrade` never write `.mcp.json`.
- **Bundled tier-2 profiles** `go`, `dart` and `flutter` in `devflow/stack-profiles/`, mirrored by
  `sync-runtime`. An `extends` id resolves from the user/org tier
  (`~/.claude/devflow/stacks/<id>.md`) first, then the bundled tier; the mirror never touches the
  user/org dir.
- **Components drafting.** `stack init` finds language areas up to three directories deep and drafts
  `components` for monorepos (path with a trailing slash, joined onto each command's cwd). A
  `{file, contains}` detect marker tells pure Dart from Flutter.
- `validate health` W033: a `.mcp.json` server whose binary is missing (advisory, never repaired).
- `confirm_stack_profile` step in the `adopt` and `map-codebase` workflows, and `mcp__gopls__*` /
  `mcp__dart__*` grants on the executor, verifier and debugger agents.
- **SubagentStop executor completion gate** (`hooks/gate-executor-stop.js`; objective 44, AUT-02). A
  `devflow:executor` that stops naturally while its TRD has no `<id>-SUMMARY.md` in any checkout is
  blocked once and told to finish, or at least write the `## Progress` checkpoint. The TRD is read
  from the first prompt of the agent transcript. An ambiguous or unidentifiable prompt, the re-stop
  (`stop_hook_active`), a checkpoint/escalation/preflight stop, or any error lets it stop. Escape:
  `DEVFLOW_SKIP_EXECUTOR_STOP_GATE=1`.
- **Auto-continue Stop hook** (`hooks/auto-continue.js`; objective 44, AUT-06). When a skill marker
  is live, no background task is running, and the last sentence announces the model's own next step
  ("Writing the predicate.", "Ready for wave 4 on your word.") without asking, the turn is blocked
  once and the model is told to take that step or ask one explicit question. Questions, ask phrases,
  `/devflow:` hand-offs, waits and result reports never fire it. Escape: `DEVFLOW_SKIP_AUTOCONTINUE=1`.
- **Migration 0008 (auto)** (objective 44, AUT-05, DF-10). Gitignores `.planning/.progress-guard.json`
  and `.planning/.awareness-cache.json` and untracks them (`git rm --cached --force`), keeping the
  working copies. It applies only when a file is tracked, or present and not ignored by the repo's
  own rules; a personal global excludes file does not count.
- **INCOMPLETE executor outcome in `execute-objective`** (objective 44, AUT-01, DF-01). A run whose
  notification says `turn limit` / `partial result`, or whose SUMMARY is missing or checkpoint-only
  with fewer commits than tasks, is INCOMPLETE, not failed. It is resumed with `SendMessage` to the
  same task (at most 3 times, "do not re-research") before the fresh-respawn failure protocol. Its
  worktree is kept until it completes, and its dependents wait instead of being skipped.
- **doc-refs legacy agent-path guard** (objective 44, AUT-03, DF-04). `doc-refs.repo.test.cjs` fails
  CI when shipped text tells an agent to read a `~/.claude/agents/<name>.md` file
  (`scanLegacyAgentPaths`, `LEGACY_AGENT_EXEMPT`).

### Changed
- **`stack init` is grounded in the codebase.** It reads GitHub Actions structurally, classifies
  shell by the tool it runs, and reads Makefile/Taskfile/justfile/npm-family/`bin/` targets. Every
  candidate command is verified before it is written; a key whose candidates all fail becomes
  `run: discover`, with a note in the draft and in `STACK-REPORT.md`, rather than a guessed command.
- The example go/dart/flutter profiles moved from `docs/stack-profiles/` to
  `plugins/devflow/devflow/stack-profiles/`. The go `format` gate now fails on unformatted files,
  dart `audit` is `none` with a non-gating `outdated`, and the dart/flutter MCP servers use
  `--enable`/`--disable` feature flags instead of a tool whitelist that dropped `dtd`.
- **Executor and verifier have no turn cap** (objective 44, AUT-01, DF-01). `maxTurns: 50` / `30` is
  gone from their frontmatter; `guard-no-progress.js` remains the runaway guard.
- **The executor commits once per task through `df-tools commit`** and keeps a `## Progress`
  checkpoint in its SUMMARY.md; a SUMMARY without `## Self-Check` is a checkpoint, not a completion.
  It never `sleep`s and then polls: long waits use `run_in_background` or Monitor (objective 44,
  AUT-01, AUT-07).
- **`mode: "yolo"` counts as autonomous between waves** (objective 44, AUT-06, DF-14).
  `execute-objective` announces and spawns the next wave in the same turn instead of asking
  "Continue?". Failure handling still keys on `mode: "autonomous"`.
- **research-synthesizer returns text** (objective 44, AUT-07, DF-08). It has `tools: Read, Bash` and
  returns SUMMARY.md between `--- BEGIN SUMMARY.md ---` / `--- END SUMMARY.md ---` markers. The
  `new-project` and `milestone new` orchestrators write it and commit `.planning/research/`.
- **The planner has `Edit`** (objective 44, AUT-07, DF-09); revision mode uses it for targeted TRD
  revisions and keeps `Write` for new or wholly rewritten TRDs.
- **`research-objective` spawns the typed `objective-researcher` agent** instead of
  `general-purpose` plus a read instruction (objective 44, AUT-03, DF-04).
- **`config-get` returns documented defaults** (objective 44, AUT-07, DF-07). A known-but-unset key
  prints its `templates/config.json` default with exit 0 (`workflow.parallelization` → `true`,
  `gates.editGate` → `strict`). A value set in a legacy or alias form still wins, and unknown keys
  still fail with `Key not found`. **Behaviour change:** `config-get workflow.auto_advance` now returns
  the loader default, `true`, for configs that don't set it, which matches `loadConfig`. Workflows that
  fell back to `|| echo "false"` on those projects now auto-advance, and an executor in auto mode
  auto-approves their `human-verify` checkpoints (look-lock excepted) and takes the first option at
  `decision` checkpoints. Set
  `workflow.auto_advance: false` to keep the old behaviour.
- **`objective-job-index` is checkpoint-aware** (objective 44, AUT-01). A SUMMARY with `## Progress`
  and no `## Self-Check` counts as incomplete, so a re-run resumes that TRD. `task_count` counts real
  `<task>` elements (line start, outside code fences) instead of reporting 0 for every XML-task TRD,
  so executor model selection sees the true size.

### Fixed
- CI drafting no longer emits `\` continuation fragments, comments, `echo` lines, bare flags or
  `${{ }}`-only lines as commands.
- `provenance.reviewed` in a drafted STACK.md is the local date, not the UTC date
  (`helpers.localDate`).
- `stack validate` warns on placeholder skill pins at every tier (STK010, also surfaced by
  `validate health` W032) and rejects a positional path instead of silently validating
  `.planning/STACK.md`.
- **The edit gate no longer denies DevFlow's own agents** (objective 44, AUT-04, DF-03). `gate-edits.js`
  allows Edit/Write/MultiEdit when the PreToolUse payload's `agent_type` is `devflow:<name>`, even with
  no live skill marker (an ad-hoc orchestrator, or after the 8h TTL).
- **The commit gate allows merge, rebase and cherry-pick completions and stops suggesting an
  unworkable `export`** (objective 44, AUT-04, DF-02). `gate-commits.js` allows a commit when every
  target repo's per-worktree git dir has `MERGE_HEAD`, `REBASE_HEAD`, `rebase-merge/`,
  `rebase-apply/` or `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` (resolved fs-only through `git -C`, `--git-dir=` and worktree
  `.git` files), or when every commit invocation carries an inline
  `DEVFLOW_ALLOW_RAW_COMMIT=1 git commit …` prefix. The deny text no longer suggests
  `export DEVFLOW_ALLOW_RAW_COMMIT=1`, which a PreToolUse hook can never see, and `docs/USER-GUIDE.md`
  is corrected to match. The hook now fails open on any internal error.
- **Spawn prompts no longer read legacy `~/.claude/agents` files** (objective 44, AUT-03, DF-04).
  `plan-objective`, `new-project`, `security-audit`, `quick`, `execute-objective` and
  `research-objective` told agents to read an agent file that global-upgrade had moved to backup,
  wasting a turn on every spawn.
- **Runtime state files no longer dirty repos** (objective 44, AUT-05, DF-10). Migration 0008 untracks
  them, and `upgrade-project.js` no longer skips its auto-commit because `.progress-guard.json`
  changed.
- **`df-tools commit` no longer re-tracks a file removed with `git rm --cached`** (objective 44,
  AUT-05). A staged removal whose working copy still exists is committed from the whole index instead
  of being re-staged by the `--files` pathspec. If anything outside `--files` is staged, the commit is
  refused with `staged_removal_with_foreign_index`.
- `config-get constructor` and other prototype names no longer resolve to Object built-ins; they
  fail with `Key not found` (objective 44, AUT-07).

## [2.11.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added
- **Stack profile (`.planning/STACK.md`).** `df-tools stack resolve|context|validate|command|init`
  resolves a per-project stack profile over bundled `general` → `~/.claude/devflow/stacks/<id>.md`
  → project → component tiers, with per-field provenance and per-agent slices. `stack init` drafts
  one from CI, task-runner and manifest evidence and writes only with `--write`.
- `validate health` Check 12: invalid profile (E030), unresolved `extends` (W030), undefined
  loop/gate key (W031), profile warnings (W032), profile absent but detectable (I030). Never auto-repaired.
- Detectors recognise Dart, Kotlin and Swift, and read installed org profiles' `detect` markers.
- **Upgrade in place.** `df-tools upgrade [--check|--apply] [--only id] [--confirm] [--path dir]
  [--kind k] [--default-work w] [--global]` brings a DevFlow project (or `~/.claude` with `--global`)
  forward to the running version. It reports `{from, to, applied, pending, pending_confirm, skipped,
  failed, changed_files, backup}`.
- Migration registry `lib/migrations/` holds detection-based, idempotent migrations, each with an
  `auto` or `confirm` safety level: 0001 config-stamp, 0002 job-to-trd, 0003 state-json-seed,
  0004 objective-md-backfill, 0005 claude-md-block and 0006 kind-work (confirm). Backups are written
  outside the repo, to `~/.claude/devflow/backups/<repo>-<hash>/<ts>/`.
- A per-project stamp in `.planning/config.json`: `devflow{version, migrations_applied, upgraded_at}`.
- SessionStart hook `upgrade-project.js`. It applies the auto migrations using the bundled df-tools,
  then commits exactly the changed files in a detached background process. The commit is skipped
  during a rebase, merge, cherry-pick or bisect, on a detached HEAD, over uncommitted edits, or if
  signing fails; signing is never bypassed. Escape: `DEVFLOW_SKIP_UPGRADE=1`.
- One-shot notices (`.planning/.devflow-notices.json`), emitted once through `route-results.js`.
- Managed, versioned CLAUDE.md blocks (`<!-- DEVFLOW:START v=<ver> src=<template> -->` …
  `<!-- DEVFLOW:END -->`) via `lib/managed-block.cjs`. Bytes outside the block are preserved
  exactly, and legacy unversioned markers count as stale.
- Global upgrade (`lib/global-upgrade.cjs`, run by `sync-runtime.js` after a successful mirror).
  Legacy `~/.claude/skills/df-*`, `~/.claude/agents/df-*` and `~/.claude/devflow/VERSION` are moved
  to a backup, never deleted. The `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` DevFlow block is managed; the first adoption
  over a hand-written section is notice-only until `df-tools upgrade --global --confirm`.
- `validate health` W040: the project is behind the running DevFlow version.
- **`/devflow:adopt [path]`.** Unattended adoption of an existing repo: maps the code, infers
  `PROJECT.md`/`STACK.md`, scaffolds config/STATE/`state.json`/ROADMAP with no invented objectives,
  adds the CLAUDE.md managed block, stamps the version, and lands everything as one signed commit
  on `devflow/adopt` -- never pushed. `.planning/ADOPT-REPORT.md` lists every low-confidence
  inference for review. Routes already-DevFlow repos to `upgrade` and empty repos to
  `/devflow:new-project`; refuses a dirty, mid-rebase/merge, detached-HEAD or non-git target
  without touching it. Resumable -- a half-finished adopt continues rather than duplicating.
  `df-tools adopt preflight|begin|scaffold|report`. A global `df-tools --cwd <dir>` flag lets any
  command target a path other than the caller's cwd. `lib/repo-state.cjs` is the one
  devflow/greenfield/brownfield/scratch detector shared by adopt, `new-project` and
  `map-codebase`. `map-codebase` gained a `--non-interactive` mode.
- **Backup pruning.** Runs from the `upgrade-project.js` SessionStart hook, throttled to once per
  24 hours, keeping backups younger than 14 days and always the newest 5 per repo; configurable via
  `backups.retain_days` / `backups.keep_min` in `~/.claude/devflow/global-config.json`. Run or
  preview by hand with `df-tools upgrade --prune [--dry-run]`; register a repo without a full
  upgrade with `upgrade --register`. Skip with `DEVFLOW_SKIP_PRUNE=1`.
- **Documentation stays truthful as commands change.** `DEPRECATION_MAP` plus a new
  `REMOVED_COMMANDS` list in `lib/skill-route.cjs` are the only rename source; `lib/doc-refs.cjs`
  resolves `/df:`/`/devflow:` tokens to ok | prefix | renamed | removed | unknown and rewrites
  them. `doc-refs.repo.test.cjs` fails `npm test` on any stale or unknown command reference in
  DevFlow's own live text (agents, skills, workflows, references, templates, README, CLAUDE.md,
  USER-GUIDE, site content), with a justified exemption list.
- Migration `0007-doc-refs-fix` (auto) rewrites renamed/`/df:` references inside a project's
  CLAUDE.md DEVFLOW block and STATE.md (outside `## Session Log`) at session start, leaving
  historical records and removed commands untouched.
- `validate health` Check 14 and the new `df-tools validate docs [--raw]` report doc-staleness
  advisories: W050 (removed-command reference), W051 (STACK.md review age), W052
  (declared-vs-detected language drift), W053 (codebase maps N commits behind), W054 (the check
  itself failed) — all advisory-only, never repaired.
- `df-tools telemetry [--raw]` is now a real CLI command (previously advertised in CLAUDE.md but
  unimplemented); it merges the same doc-staleness advisories. `/devflow:status`'s report step
  shows them in a `## Documentation` section.
- `df-tools context [--limit N] [--root <dir>] [--raw]` is now a real CLI command (previously
  printed `Unknown command`); implemented in `lib/context-audit.cjs`, scanning `~/.claude/projects`
  by default with `--limit 150` the typical audit window.
- `df-tools session-audit [--since YYYY-MM-DD] [--limit N] [--root <dir>] [--raw]` is now a real
  CLI command (previously printed `Unknown command`); implemented in `lib/session-audit.cjs`,
  classifying blocking events from the same `~/.claude/projects` transcripts.
- `df-tools transcript-export [--out <file>] [--full <dir>] [--limit N] [--root <dir>] [--raw]` is
  now a real CLI command (previously printed `Unknown command`); implemented in
  `lib/transcript-export.cjs`, appending to the index at `~/.claude/devflow/transcript-index.jsonl`
  before retention deletes transcripts.
- `df-tools override --gate <g> --reason <why> | --list [--limit N]` is now a real CLI command
  (previously printed `Unknown command`); implemented in `lib/override.cjs`, a structured, logged
  replacement for prose gate overrides.
- The dispatch-completeness test (`lib/dispatch-completeness.test.cjs`) checks CLAUDE.md's command
  prose against the actual dispatcher; the hook-inventory pin test (`lib/hook-inventory.test.cjs`)
  checks CLAUDE.md's hook bullets against `hooks.json` registration.
- CI guards `lib/rg-flag-guard.test.cjs` (fails on any rg invocation with `E` in a short-flag
  cluster across live plugin prose) and `lib/gitignore-markers.test.cjs` (every file-backed
  `override.cjs` gate marker must have a `.planning/<name>` line in `.gitignore`).

### Changed
- `project-state.cjs`, `detect brownfield-map` and `init new-project` now delegate to
  `repo-state.cjs` (`init new-project` counts source files at any depth, not only 3 levels).
- The SessionStart init-offer for brownfield repos now points at `/devflow:adopt`; `route-intent`
  routes "adopt this repo", "set up devflow here" and "bootstrap this repo" (also outside existing
  DevFlow projects); the global routing template (v2) lists `/devflow:adopt`. `/devflow:new-project`
  offers `/devflow:adopt` for existing code and registers the repo for pruning.
- Planner `<validation_gates>` come from `stack command`; the executor runs the profile `loop` and
  `gates.task`, refuses hand edits to generated files, and lists discovered commands in SUMMARY.
- `testing-strategy.md` no longer guesses a stack from `kind`; its stack cells moved to example
  profiles and the Rails column is gone. Web/TS tables are labelled as examples.
- `lib/json-schema-lite.cjs` is the shared schema walker (extracted from ui-spec-validate).
- `/devflow:status check --migrate` (the `health --migrate` workflow) runs `df-tools upgrade`.
- `validate health --repair` runs migrations 0001-0003 for its config, JOB and `state.json`
  repairs. The config repair now writes the nested template shape, not the stale flat keys.
- `templates/claude-md.md` says "Objectives" and uses `~/.claude/devflow` paths.
- Migration backups are written outside the repo (`~/.claude/devflow/backups/`), not to
  `.planning/.migrate-backup-*`.
- The JOB→TRD migration no longer forces STATE.md `Status: Resumed`.
- The missing-`kind` intent warning points at `/devflow:status check --migrate`
  (`df-tools upgrade --apply --only 0006 --kind <kind>`).

### Fixed
- Verifier Step 8 read a stack field from `project.md` that never existed, so every non-web,
  non-Flutter project was SKIPPED. It now selects by `verification.runtime`, runs `gates.objective`,
  and states its reason when it skips.
- `health --migrate` advertised a migration it never ran; it now runs the upgrade.
- Changes made by the `init` bootstrap (created `OBJECTIVE.md` files) were silent. The
  plan-objective and execute-objective workflows now report them in one line.
- `backfillAllObjectives` was dead code. It now backs migration 0004.
- W002 (`validate health`) now matches current STATE.md wording instead of a dead
  `[Pp]hase\s+N` regex, and is no longer repairable (it can never trigger `regenerateState`).
- Stale `/df:` and retired command names removed from the health fix text, the `misc.cjs`
  CONTEXT scaffold, the `workstreams.cjs` worktree STATE.md generator, the statusline's dead
  `/df:update` segment (no writer ever produced its cache file), and the init todo-lane
  preview (now `/devflow:todo list`).
- README, USER-GUIDE, workflows and agents name only live commands — the 13 retired
  single-purpose names (progress, health, resume-work, pause-work, add/insert/remove-objective,
  new/audit/complete-milestone, plan-milestone-gaps, add-todo, check-todos) are gone, and
  `/devflow:update` / `/devflow:reapply-patches` are deleted with no successor.
- CLAUDE.md's hook inventory now marks `inject-org-context.js` / `inject-handoff-results.js` as
  draft/unregistered instead of listing them among live hooks; site doc examples use the real gate
  name `--gate edits`, not `--gate gate-edits`.
- `df-tools init milestone-op` (and the other init compounds) report the in-progress milestone
  from the `## Milestones` list (the in-progress entry, then the highest shipped, then the lowest
  planned) instead of the first version string in ROADMAP.md, which named v1.1 "candidates" on
  this repo.
- `df-tools objective complete` appends one idempotent `**Objective complete:**` line on narrative
  STATE.md files, and `state_updated` now reports an actual write, with a `state_update_reason`
  (`already_logged`, `no_log_anchor`, `state_missing`, `unchanged`) when nothing was written.
  `objective remove --confirm` likewise reports `state_updated` from an actual write.
- TRD and verification references state that ripgrep `-E` is `--encoding`, not extended regex,
  and name `rg -n -e PATTERN` / `rg -nP PATTERN` as the forms to use in `<verify>`/`<done>` checks.
- `remove-objective.md` takes integer objective numbers and no longer advertises decimal numbers
  as a live scheme; legacy pre-v1.2 decimal directories are still accepted for removal.
- `df-tools intent resolve --objective <N>` resolves bare and zero-padded numbers to slugged
  objective directories (`40` → `40-tooling-correctness`) instead of silently inheriting
  PROJECT.md `default_work`, and warns `OBJECTIVE.md not found` (or names every candidate when a
  number is ambiguous).
- `df-tools roadmap update-job-progress <N>` ticks objective N's nested `- [ ] NN-MM-TRD.md`
  checkboxes (scoped to N, no Status rollups) and reports `trd_checkboxes_ticked`.
- `df-tools state record-session` updates the plain-text `Last session:` / `Stopped at:` /
  `Resume file:` lines inside `## Session Continuity` on narrative STATE.md files (previously
  always `recorded: false`).
- `.planning/.edit-override` is gitignored.
- `planner` and `ui-evaluator` lost their 28-03 `effort` declarations (`xhigh` / `high`) in the
  PR #68 merge; both are restored. The agent, workflow and skill prompts that still named the
  obsolete `df-ui-evaluator` profile key now use the canonical `ui-evaluator`.
  `model-profiles.test.cjs` now pins the `references/model-profiles.md` effort column to agent
  frontmatter and fails on any backticked `df-<agent>` profile key in agents, skills or workflows.
- The planner's novel-domain auto-research told a subagent to spawn `objective-researcher`, which a
  subagent cannot do, so the path never ran. The planner now returns `## RESEARCH NEEDED` with the
  `detect novel-domain` signals, and plan-objective (step 10) and `/devflow:build` run the researcher
  and re-spawn the planner once. `agent-tools.test.cjs` now catches `Task(` / `Agent(` /
  `subagent_type=` spawn instructions in agents whose `tools:` cannot spawn.
- `sync-runtime` no longer downgrades `~/.claude/devflow`. A session started from an older plugin
  cache re-mirrored over a newer mirror, so the mirror flip-flopped. It was found at 2.7.1 with
  2.10.1 installed. The hook now mirrors only when the mirror's version is missing or unparseable,
  when the plugin is strictly newer (numeric semver, prerelease-aware), or when versions match but
  `bin/df-tools.cjs` is missing. An unparseable plugin version never overwrites a parseable mirror.
- Two CodeQL alerts new in PR #114: `mergeFrontmatter` (`stack-profile.cjs`) now refuses
  `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` keys before any read or assignment
  (js/prototype-pollution-utility), and `roadmap-progress.cjs`'s row/header matchers now fully
  escape the objective number via a local `escapeRegExp` instead of hand-escaping only the first
  `.` (js/regex-injection).

## [2.10.1] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed
- **`df-tools micro commit` never stages untracked files.** Without `--files` it fell back to
  `git add .`, sweeping every untracked file in the repository into the micro's commit, which
  once carried a user's unrelated draft documents onto a pushed PR branch. It now commits exactly
  what is already staged, or, if nothing is, tracked modifications only (`git add -u`). A new
  file must be named with `--files`, and the refusal says so. `commitMicro` also removes its
  own `.planning/.micro-description` scratch file, which the sweep used to commit.
- **A labelled-broken state can no longer pass anonymously** (#72). `scoreState` blocks on
  HIGH severity only, which is policy and is unchanged, so a state judged `is_broken: true` at
  MEDIUM/LOW reported `verdict: "pass"` and appeared in none of `fails[]`, `reviews[]` or
  `unjudged[]`. The run was indistinguishable from a clean one. Such a state now carries
  `known_broken: true` and `max_severity` in its detail, and the rollup gains a
  `known_broken[]` bucket and `counts.known_broken`. The verdict and exit code are unchanged.
  `verifier.md` Step 8c records known-broken states in `notes:`, keeps their surface on the
  human-verification list, and never retires a surface whose binding pass carries one.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-09-26

Contract hardening after W1b: the tools stop answering yes when nothing was checked, stop
mutating anything when asked for help, and an executor has to prove which repository and base
it is standing in. **One BREAKING change, narrow in scope:** `ui spec validate|render`,
`ui sheet` and `ui lock` (all first shipped in 2.9.0) now exit `2` when a check did not run.
Any other caller is unaffected.

### Added
- **`df-tools exec-context check|worktree`** (#86) — a dispatched executor's repository
  and base are now stated by the orchestrator and proven by the agent, instead of being
  inferred by the harness. `check --repo <path> [--base <ref>]` exits 1 with
  `WRONG REPOSITORY` (naming both the expected repo and the one it is actually in) or
  `BASE NOT VISIBLE` (naming the missing commit); a linked worktree of the target repo
  passes, because identity is the git *common* directory, not the checkout.
  `worktree --repo <path> --id <slug> [--base <ref>]` provisions isolation explicitly, in
  the named repo, from a base that defaults to that repo's **current HEAD** — never the
  default branch.

### Changed
- **BREAKING (exit contract) — `df-tools ui spec validate|render`, `ui sheet` and `ui lock` now
  exit `2` when a check did not run.** `0` is checked and clean, `1` is a real violation, `2` is
  "nothing violated, but one or more checks reported MISSING". Previously a MISSING row exited
  `0`, so the two outcomes a gate has to distinguish — *checked and clean* versus *never checked*
  — were the same number to the idiom every gate is written with (`validate "$spec" || exit 1`),
  and an invariant that was never evaluated read as verified. The row's own message already said
  "§4.5 I5 is UNCHECKED for this spec, which is not the same as passing"; the process now says it
  too. `PROPOSAL-ui-oracle-loop.md` states the rule in three places (§2 goal 5, §4.5, §7.5) and
  this was the one place the engine contradicted it. A caller that genuinely accepts an
  incomplete check tests for it (`[ $? -eq 2 ]`) rather than inheriting it. On `render`, `sheet`
  and `lock`, **exit 2 means the artifact was produced** — the graph printed, the sheet written,
  the lock recorded; only `1` refuses. `ui sheet` counts its own second axis of incompleteness:
  a declared state with no render exits 2 as well. (#90)
- **The verdict JSON carries `complete` and `unchecked` beside `ok`.** `ok` is unchanged and
  still honestly named — it counts REAL VIOLATIONS — but it never stood alone as an answer.
  `complete: false` and `unchecked: ["PAT000"]` (the codes of the checks that did not run,
  joinable to `errors[]`) make the payload unreadable as a pass by a consumer that reads only
  `ok`. `ui spec render`'s bare (all-artifacts) payload and `ui sheet`'s and `ui lock`'s payloads
  carry the same two fields. The short-circuit verdicts (`SPEC000`, `SPEC002`) report
  `complete: false` too: they stop before any invariant runs. (#90)
- **`devflow:executor` no longer declares `isolation: worktree`** (#86). The harness
  resolved that isolation implicitly and got both halves wrong in a multi-repo programme:
  the repo came from the *controller session's* cwd (an aodex objective dispatched from an
  aodex worktree put the first executor in devflow-claude, silently — every path it was
  given pointed into a repo it could not see), and the base was the *default branch*, so
  wave 2 of a sequential objective could not see wave 1's commits. Every executor in the UI
  Oracle Loop programme had to be run as a plain `general-purpose` subagent to work around
  it. The executor now runs in the working directory the dispatch names and proves repo and
  base in a `<repo_base_preflight>` first step; `execute-objective.md` fixes `REPO_ROOT` and
  a per-wave `WAVE_BASE` before spawning and provisions parallel-wave worktrees itself.

### Fixed
- **`sync-roadmap` reconciles slugless TRD lines.** `roadmap-reconcile.cjs` required a slug
  between the id and `-TRD.md`, so ROADMAP lines of the form `- [ ] 32-01-TRD.md — …` were
  skipped silently, and `sync-roadmap --dry-run` reported zero drift while objectives 32 and
  33 had every SUMMARY on disk. The slug is now optional in both the TRD-line and the rollup
  regex. (#104)
- **CI runs node 26, not 22** (#101). A `describe`-scoped `after()` hook that throws exits
  `0` with no `<failure>` in the junit report on node 22.23.3 **and** 24.13.1 — the suite is
  red and every channel says green, so the gate could not see it. On 25.9.0 and 26.10.0 the
  process exits `1`, which the unit gate's Guard 0 already fails. `test.yml` and
  `agent-shell-harness.yml` now pin `26`; the allowlist's `$environment` is restated.
- **`exec-context check` refuses a parallel sibling on a shared index** (#98) — with
  `--id` + `--base`, check claims (checkout, base); a second plan id on the same claim exits 1
  with `SHARED INDEX` instead of racing on one git index. New `exec-context release` clears a
  stale claim. Executor prompt and `executor.md` now pass `--id`.
- **`df-tools <command> --help` no longer mutates anything** (#87). `--help`/`-h` is
  answered by the dispatcher *before* it selects a subcommand, so no subcommand can
  receive a help flag as data. `df-tools commit --help` used to take `--help` as the
  commit **message**, find no `--files`, and commit whatever was dirty — succeeding
  silently and printing a hash. Six other subcommands shared the shape and were
  verified to write on the pre-fix binary: `config-set` (wrote a key named `--help`),
  `milestone complete` (archived a milestone `--help`), `handoff create`, `micro start`,
  `changelog update`, `project-decline`. `objective add` was the only one that had its
  own guard. Every top-level command now has a usage entry in `bin/lib/help.cjs`, and
  `help.test.cjs` fails if a dispatcher arm is missing one. Commands that already print
  richer help of their own (`awareness`, `org-awareness`, `dup-detect`,
  `defaults-table init`, `flutter-ui bootstrap|eval|design-review`,
  `verify flutter-ui-eval`, `gh resolve`) are delegated to rather than overridden, and
  `help-delegation.test.cjs` holds each of them to the same contract: exit 0, print
  something useful, change nothing.
- **`df-tools commit` refuses a message starting with `--`** (#87) — far likelier a
  mistyped flag than an intended subject line.
- **`df-tools commit` with no `--files` is scoped to `.planning/`** (#87). It staged
  `.planning/` and then ran a bare `git commit -m`, which commits the *whole* index —
  so the blast radius was the entire dirty tree. `--files` is unchanged and remains the
  recommended form; it was not made mandatory, because the no-`--files` form is the
  documented "commit the planning docs" path used by callers outside this repo.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-09-22

W1b of the UI Oracle Loop (`docs/PROPOSAL-ui-oracle-loop.md`): a UI surface can now be
described once, in one hand-authored file, and machine-checked. The Surface Spec gets a schema,
a validator with eight invariants and named error codes, a renderer that derives the ui-eval
manifest and the human-readable review artifacts from the same file, a review sheet, and a
look-lock that survives a typo fix but not a shape change. Alongside it, a shell harness that
executes the fenced bash in agent prose under the real Bash-tool model — and which found 40
defects in `agents/executor.md`'s own Flutter instructions on first contact.

### Added
- **`df-tools ui spec validate <file> [--patterns <catalogue.json>]`** — the eight §4.5 invariants
  (I1–I8), each with its own error code: `SPEC000-002`, `ROUTE001-003`, `CTRL001-006`,
  `STATE001-003`, `PAT000-002`, `HIT000-002`, `FLOW001-002`, `GUARD001`. Twelve known-broken
  fixtures live in `__fixtures__/ui-spec/broken/`, each one a copy of the positive control plus a
  single edit, and each failing with **exactly one** code equal to its own `<!-- BROKEN: -->`
  marker — a gate whose every branch is proven reachable from the real binary, not from a unit
  test that stubs the CLI away. Exit 1 on any real violation (c1f7027, 346a450, a1d8e0a, 89e7c61,
  cfa5bce, e574962, 3588ed2, 3f3e854, 97283ef)
- **`df-tools ui spec render <file> [--manifest|--graph|--table]`** — four artifacts derived from
  the one hand-authored spec, so they cannot drift from it: a `flutter-ui-eval` manifest that
  carries all eight keys on **every** state (`state_id`, `seed`, `as`, `fault`, `references`,
  `theme`, `viewport`, `content`) and loads through the existing engine untouched; a mermaid nav
  graph whose node ids are kind-prefixed (`route_`/`ctrl_`/`state_`) so two namespaces cannot
  collapse onto one node; a control table rendered as plain English, one line per `when`, with
  negations spelled out; and a capture list over state × theme × width with a filename-safe
  `capture_id`. Three byte-stable snapshots are committed as the determinism control (a67137b,
  50aff43, 981c9e3, 70367e7, 171913d, 6f7315f)
- **`df-tools ui sheet <spec> --out <file>`** — a single-page review sheet a human can actually
  look at: the nav graph, the control table, and one row per capture with its render inlined as a
  `data:` URI. Its `sheet_hash` is a sha256 over the *model*, not the HTML, so a CSS tweak to the
  template does not invalidate a human's approval — while a state moving `MISSING` → `present`
  does move it. `engine_version` is deliberately excluded from the hash: had it been included,
  this very release's version bump would have silently cleared every look-lock in every repo
  (08aefee, e492fa0, 145030c)
- **`df-tools ui lock <spec> --sheet-hash <64 hex> --by <email>`** — the look-lock. It hashes
  exactly three keys (`routes`, `controls`, `states`) through the sheet's one canonicalisation
  path, and stores per-section hashes so a cleared verdict can name *which* section moved. Proven
  in both directions by mutating a real spec and re-reading the status: a `kind:`, `path:` or
  `seed:` edit reports `cleared` and names the section; an appended paragraph, a heading edit, or a
  `design_read`/`references`/`flows` change reports `held` with `locked_at` untouched. A lock that
  survives a shape change is a false approval; a lock that dies on a typo fix is worse than no lock
  (5111793, 3e46c04)
- **Surface Spec schema v1** (`devflow/schemas/surface-spec.schema.json`, `$id`
  `.../surface-spec/v1`) and the fixed seven-term `must_not` vocabulary, both mirrored to
  `~/.claude/devflow` and loaded relative to `__dirname` so they resolve from the mirror as well as
  the checkout (ba6dc36, dd0f241, 261de0d)
- **`yaml-lite`** — a dependency-free YAML **subset** parser (`bin/lib/yaml-lite.cjs`, zero
  `require()` calls of any kind), because this repo permits no new npm dependency and a Surface
  Spec's front matter must not be parsed by the lenient splitter DevFlow's own TRD files use. Its
  refusal list is **closed**, not best-effort: twelve constructs (anchors, aliases, the merge key,
  block scalars, tags, tab indentation, document markers, nested inline sequences, explicit keys,
  a dedent to an unopened column, duplicate keys, implicit single-pair flow maps) each throw with a
  1-based line number. A 29-construct audit of the finished parser found two *silent mis-parses*
  the planned test list never named — `- - x` read as the string `'- x'`, and `"a b": 1` keeping
  its quotes in the key — and both are now refused by name (32dd182, d6ae517, 7d7685d, 3d79a5e,
  1f135f6, a2e1646, d2229cd, 1d5a362)
- **`frontend-design` build mode refuses to compose without a valid, locked spec** — a new step 5
  locates or drafts the Surface Spec, and the skill declines to compose when `ok: false` or the
  lock is anything but `held`, with a separate imperative for each of `absent`, `cleared` and
  `MISSING`. `PAT000`/`HIT000` MISSING rows deliberately do **not** block: had the refusal read
  `errors.length > 0` instead of `ok`, every surface in the repo would be blocked today. Proven
  across five real spec states through the real binary — four refuse, one proceeds (2cbd0a7,
  3412be9)
- **The agent shell harness** (`bin/lib/agent-shell-harness.cjs`) — it extracts the fenced bash
  from a named section of an agent file and runs it under the model agents actually face: cwd
  persists between calls, shell variables do **not**, one logical command per call, `set -u`, a
  hermetic PATH, a 10s timeout and a containment pre-check. A bare `cd sub` is a `cwd-leak`
  finding and exits 1; `( cd sub && cmd )` exits 0. A `# harness:` annotation vocabulary
  (`expect`, `expect-cwd`, `expect-exit`, `derive`, `subst`, `skip`) lets correct-but-illustrative
  prose declare its intent, and an unknown annotation is a finding rather than a silent no-op — as
  is a `skip`, which counts toward MISSING and never toward pass (7eba11e, d66153a, 89586ba,
  4a1d871, bcdfddf, efabe1d, 8d64c34, 7ebc391, 0354015, cfcdacd, d15e0b1, 39b6f44, 0c30bdf,
  d8619cb, aeca056, 35646f8, a2358a1, 153e06f)
- **CI runs the harness against `agents/executor.md` on every agent-prose PR** —
  `.github/workflows/agent-shell-harness.yml`, with the stub binaries' executable bit checked up
  front and the harness's exit code unswallowed, so a finding fails the job (c005bfc)
- **`look-lock` is a documented checkpoint variant** — `references/checkpoints.md` gains the
  variant that the verifier agent may **not** stand in for. It asks "is this the right design",
  not "does it work", so machine evidence cannot answer it; in autonomous mode it falls through to
  the user exactly as `checkpoint:human-action` does, and is never blind-approved (593b8fc)

### Fixed
- **`agents/executor.md`'s Flutter instructions did not work, and nobody could have known** — the
  first run of the new harness against the real file produced **40 findings across three sections,
  all three failing**. The prose had been read many times and had never been executed. Eight
  concrete defects were fixed and one deliberate non-change recorded: the bootstrap capture chained
  four shell variables across four separate Bash calls (`BOOTSTRAP: unbound variable`) while the
  paragraph directly beneath it already said they would not survive; the setup-task extraction
  repeated the same defect and its bash block was deleted in favour of prose; the hard-fail message
  interpolated a `$MISSING` that was never set, exiting 127; the analyze baseline-diff carried both
  a dead variable and a multi-line `if/fi` that split into `syntax error near unexpected token
  'fi'`; fourteen `$REPO_ROOT`/`$PACKAGE_DIR`/`$OBJECTIVE_DIR` placeholders are now declared per
  call with `# harness: derive`, which reaches exactly one call so an *undeclared* variable still
  fails; illustrative `<path/to/test.dart>` placeholders are declared with `subst` rather than
  rewritten, turning the prose's own "MUST exit non-zero" into a real assertion; five evidence
  `mv`s that exited 0 whether or not anything moved gained `# harness: expect <artifact>`; and the
  chromedriver guard's correct `exit 1` is now declared rather than flagged. The three sections now
  run 22 calls with **zero** findings. Explicitly *not* changed:
  `CURRENT_ANALYZE=$(cd "$PACKAGE_DIR" && …)` — a `$( … )` subshell never moved the observed cwd
  and was never flagged (4a3acc0, 153e06f)
- **`devflow/schemas/` never reached the `~/.claude/devflow` mirror** — `sync-runtime.js`'s
  `SUBDIRS` is an allowlist (`workflows`, `references`, `templates`, `bin`) and the new `schemas/`
  directory was not on it. Every test passed in the checkout while `loadSurfaceSpecSchema()` would
  have thrown ENOENT on **every real skill invocation**, because skills run the mirror and not the
  repo — the exact silent-green class this objective exists to close. `schemas` is now in the
  allowlist, with a test that asserts every shipped runtime subdir reaches the mirror (c6f636a,
  d973f72)
- **The W1b interface list was a fiction at the release audit** — `ui-spec.cjs` exported only
  `parseSurfaceSpec`; `validateSurfaceSpec` and `renderSurfaceSpec` were `undefined` on it, living
  unre-exported in sibling modules. W1c, W1★ and W2 are all planned against that one front door, so
  three downstream objectives would have planned against names that did not resolve. All three are
  now reachable from `ui-spec.cjs`, re-exported as **lazy getters** — `ui-spec-render` requires
  `ui-spec-validate`, which requires `ui-spec`, so a top-level require here would close that cycle
  and hand the sibling a half-initialised module. Four cases pin it, asserting function *identity*
  with the sibling export rather than `typeof` (a stub of the right shape would satisfy a `typeof`
  check and still be a fiction), plus a cold-require differential control in a child process
  (959e403)
- **Two self-contradictions in the amended proposal, resolved normative-rule-over-illustrative-example** —
  §4.2's `acceptance.locked_sheet` literal is **65** hex characters and therefore cannot be a
  sha256, and §4.2's example declares both `within` and `disjoint_from` on the same target while
  §4.5 I6 — added in the same commit — forbids exactly that. The fixtures follow the rules: the
  positive control drops the extra character and the chevron's `within` line, and §4.2's literal
  text survives verbatim as the known-broken fixture `hit-rect-within-and-disjoint.md`. **The
  proposal itself still reads both ways and needs a follow-up amendment to one side** (261de0d,
  fd1b312, 89e7c61)

### Known limitations
- **The pattern catalogue is unreachable, so every real spec carries one `PAT000 / MISSING` row.**
  W1b ships no pinned `eden-ui-flutter` release, so the validator has no catalogue to resolve
  `patterns:` references against and §4.5 I5 is **UNCHECKED** — which is deliberately *not* the
  same as passing. `ok` is `errors.every(e => e.status === 'MISSING')`, so a MISSING row does not
  block composition; treating it as a failure would block every surface in the repo, and treating
  it as a pass is the silent-green class this loop exists to forbid. Supply a catalogue with
  `--patterns <catalogue.json>` to reach the real `PAT001`/`PAT002` codes. This will look like a
  bug to the first person who runs `ui spec validate` on a real surface. It is not.
- **The I6 hit-rect model is resolvability and consistency only.** `within` and `disjoint_from`
  are checked for resolving to controls in the same spec, for reciprocity, and for never being
  declared together on one target. **Overlap itself is not statically checked** — §4.2 gives
  `hit_rect` no coordinates, so there is no field from which an overlap could be computed. Measuring
  the actual rects is W2's probe. `HIT000` remains the answer where the check could not run.
- **None of these arms is reachable from a skill until the plugin is upgraded and a new session
  starts.** Skills invoke the `~/.claude/devflow` mirror, which `sync-runtime` refreshes only when
  the bundled version differs from the cached marker. Until 2.9.0 is installed, `ui spec`,
  `ui sheet` and `ui lock` exist only in this checkout — and so does the harness binary.
- **W1b does not close the loop.** It ships the spec, the validator, the renderer, the sheet, the
  lock, the skill gate and the prose harness. There is no probe, no checks and no executor CONFORM
  loop — those are W2. The `projects-rail` dogfood is W1★. `references[]` is populated but
  uncalibrated, and no `expected` judge anchor is synthesised.
- **The review sheet's `sheet_hash` covers the engine-rendered control-table prose.** A
  wording-only change in `ui-spec-render.cjs` would therefore clear every look-lock — the same
  over-trigger the design already rejected for `engine_version`. The look-lock's own shape hash is
  unaffected (it hashes `{routes, controls, states}` only). **This needs a decision before W1★.**
- **`ui spec validate`'s `lock` is nested** (`lock.lock`), so the obvious `if (out.lock !== 'held')`
  compares an object to a string and refuses every surface, including approved ones. A flattened
  alias is a W1★ candidate.
- **The harness CI job is path-filtered and is not yet a required check.** Until branch protection
  lists it, a PR that touches none of the filtered paths merges on a green tick that never ran this
  gate. Also open: `<worktree_command_discipline>` in `executor.md` forbids `&&`, pipes and `cd`
  prefixes, while the Flutter sections it shares a file with mandate `( cd "$PACKAGE_DIR" && … )`
  and pipe through `sort`/`grep`. Both rules are individually well-founded; the harness currently
  sides with the subshell form. This is a design decision, not a wording fix, and was deliberately
  left open.
- **`CTRL007` (the `must_not` vocabulary check) is reserved but not implemented**, and
  `terminal: true` is not in the schema — only `root: true`. `flows` is excluded from the look-lock's
  shape hash, on the reasoning that a flow is a walk over structure the reviewer has already seen.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-09-21

Wave 0 of the UI Oracle Loop (`docs/PROPOSAL-ui-oracle-loop.md`): the visual gate stops lying, resolution is objective-scoped, health reports engine lag, monorepo Flutter packages resolve, and a UI-loop baseline metric ships.

### Added
- **`df-tools ui metrics baseline`** — classifies conventional-commit subjects touching the given `--paths` since `--since` into feat/fix/test/refactor/other, computes `fix_per_feat` and a quick-fix count, and writes `.planning/ui-metrics-baseline.json`: the "before" numbers for the UI-process redesign, so later waves can prove improvement against a measured baseline rather than a guess (W0-6). A non-repo cwd, a flag without a value, or an unknown subcommand all exit 1 with a one-line error on stderr (2b16873)

### Fixed
- **Visual-eval engine now self-identifies** — `scoreRun` and the `flutter-ui-eval` CLI rollup stamp `engine_version`/`schema_version` on every result (reading the plugin manifest, falling back to the home-mirror marker), so a verifier can reject evidence produced by a stale engine; the resolution-skip output (not_applicable/absent/invalid) carries the same stamp, and `pluginVersion()` no longer returns `undefined` on a parseable-but-version-less `plugin.json` (8b5bd88, 5a80ef7)
- **`validate health` reports mirror/plugin/main version lag** — new `E020` (mirror stale against the running plugin) and `W021` (installed plugin behind `origin/main`) issue codes, surfaced in an `engine: { running, mirror, installed, main }` row (`running` = the version the invoked `df-tools` reports, `installed` = the plugin registry's truth, `main` = `origin/main`, `null` when unreachable) and printed as one `Engine:` header line by `/devflow:health`; both checks were structurally dead when `df-tools` runs from the `~/.claude/devflow` mirror (how every skill invokes it) until they were rewired to read Claude Code's own plugin-manager bookkeeping (`installed_plugins.json`, `known_marketplaces.json`) instead of a `__dirname` walk that resolves into the wrong directory from the mirror; stdout stays JSON-only in non-raw mode; `E020` fires only when the mirror is *behind* the installed plugin — a mirror ahead of the registry (a dev checkout) reports `I022 mirror-ahead` as info instead (b83809b, edfd931, 03fa7d5, f0436aa)
- **UI-eval manifest resolution is objective-scoped, not repo-scoped** — Tier 3 of `resolveUIEvalTarget` used to pick the lexicographically-first repo-root `ui_eval/manifests/*.manifest.json` whenever an objective had no Tier 2 evidence manifest, once scoring an unrelated objective's manifest; it now reports `resolution: 'absent', reason: 'unscoped-candidates'` with the candidate paths instead of silently loading one (06ee9cc, 782eadf)
- **UI-eval bootstrap, setup, and executor gates find a monorepo `flutter/` package** — `flutter-ui-eval-bootstrap.cjs`, `flutter-ui-bootstrap.cjs`, `flutter-ui-setup.cjs`, and the executor's Flutter gates all assumed the package lived at `<repo>/pubspec.yaml`, reporting `flutter-not-detected` on monorepo consumers (eden-biz, aodex) where it's at `<repo>/flutter/pubspec.yaml`; a shared `resolveFlutterPackageDir()` now backs all four, and the executor's flutter/maestro/adb commands run in a subshell (`( cd "$PACKAGE_DIR" && … )`) with evidence paths absolute from the repo root — this harness persists cwd across Bash calls but not shell variables, so both `$OLDPWD` and a bare `cd` were unsound; each call substitutes the literal absolute paths learned at bootstrap or re-derives them (1cea48a, 01d1f70, 19b7f48)
- **Reference docs matched the shipped visual gate, not the pre-2.4.0 state** — `testing-strategy.md`'s Flutter visual/golden cell and `Out of scope` note still called the gate "deferred"; `ui-eval.md`, `ui-evaluator.md`, `verifier.md`, and `design-review.md` still told agents to capture Flutter web via `flutter run -d chrome`, which DWDS wedges into a silent blank page. Matrix cell now points at `df-tools verify flutter-ui-eval`; capture steps now build `flutter build web --release` and serve it statically (db9c2a2, 2686bc5)

## [2.7.1] - 2026-09-03

Two gate defects and a release-tooling defect, all found while shipping 2.7.0.

### Fixed
- **The tag gate judged the wrong tree** — `changelog-on-tag.js` validated CHANGELOG.md and the three release manifests against the *working tree* rather than the commit being tagged, so tagging a historical commit was impossible. `git tag -a v2.6.0 556f8d3` was denied citing `package.json: 2.7.0` even though that commit's own tree read `2.6.0`. The gate now resolves all four files from the named commit-ish via `git show`, and names the commit in the denial. With no commit-ish the working-tree path is byte-for-byte unchanged; an unresolvable commit-ish falls back to the working tree rather than crashing or denying (quick-15)
- **The tag gate fired on mere mentions** — it matched raw command text, so any command merely *containing* a tag command in a quoted argument or heredoc body was refused. This is the same false-positive class TRD 27-04 fixed for `gate-commits.js`, never backported here. The hook now reuses that hook's exported `stripHeredocs`/`stripQuoted` before matching (quick-15)
- **Release titles came from the commit, not the tag** — `release.yml` read `%(contents:subject)` from a tag that `actions/checkout` had already materialized as a lightweight ref, so the annotated tag's message was silently discarded and every release took its release commit's subject instead. It now re-fetches the tag object before reading. This is why `v2.5.0` and `v2.3.0` are titled `chore(release): ...` (f67f7dc)

### Added
- **First test coverage for `changelog-on-tag.js`** - 23 cases across a `parseTagCommand()` unit suite and a commit-ish integration suite that builds real throwaway git repos. Every other hook already had an adjacent `.test.js`; this one had none (8ed6e0d)
- **Dependabot covers `github-actions`** - a fourth ecosystem block for `.github/workflows`, alongside the two bundler directories and root npm (efb6486)

## [2.7.0] - 2026-09-01

> **Numbering note:** this work was developed on `feature/docs-site-and-design-references`
> and released there as `2.6.0` before `2.6.0` was independently published from `main`
> (the visual-eval gate fixes, below). Two different releases claimed the same number;
> `main`'s shipped first and keeps `2.6.0`, so this one became `2.7.0` on merge.

### Added
- **deps**: `.github/dependabot.yml` — weekly bundler updates for the two MCP server directories and weekly npm updates for the repo root (9a6b4e5)
- **design**: enforce design references in eden-ui skills and executor (faa8584)
- **design**: add design craft reference set (2221ec3)
- **docs**: documentation site for devflow.cloud (9bcf4f8)
- **verify**: conditional deployment verification for verifier and integration-checker (aa4dc4c)
- **13**: let a model invoke /devflow:objective (ab83319)
- **13**: make objective remove dry-run by default behind --confirm (3b20ae2)

### Fixed
- **deps**: bump `mcp` gem 0.12.0 -> 0.25.0 in both aosentry-mcp lockfiles, closing 10 Dependabot alerts across 5 advisories (GHSA-5p9g-j988-pcwv, GHSA-h669-8m4g-r2hc, GHSA-52jp-gj8w-j6xh, GHSA-7683-3w9x-ch42, GHSA-rjr6-rcgv-9m7m). Only the stdio-transport advisory was reachable — both servers use `StdioTransport`, never the HTTP/SSE transports the other four affect (3598bb7)
- **brand**: correct font loading in eden-ui-web brand presets (3e97666)

### Docs
- link the docs site and credit taste-skill (e4fbce4)
- **quick-13**: fix plan commit-type contradiction + add SC-10 detection step (a3e214a)
- **quick-13**: verification evidence + STATE.md record (4f92c6e)
- **13**: summary for quick job 13 (f979684)
- **13**: plan objective skill un-gate + objective remove --confirm rail (380a937)

### Tests
- **13**: RED — --confirm dry-run rail for objective remove (b1e3227)

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-27

The shipped visual-eval gate did not judge anything, and the one production
caller never reached it. Objectives 32 and 33, closing
AO-Cyber-Systems/aodex#485.

> **Upgrade note:** this release exists partly *because* 2.5.0 could not deliver
> its own successor. The visual-eval fixes were merged to `main` while the
> manifest still declared `2.5.0` — the same version already in the plugin cache.
> `sync-runtime` mirrors only when the version differs, and its content sentinel
> checks that `bin/df-tools.cjs` exists rather than that the mirror matches the
> source, so a stale-but-present mirror passes. The work was unreachable until
> this bump. Verify after installing:
> `grep -c resolveUIEvalTarget ~/.claude/devflow/bin/lib/flutter-ui-eval.cjs`
> must be non-zero, and `~/.claude/devflow/bin/lib/flutter-ui-eval-resolve.cjs`
> must exist.

### Fixed
- **A state nothing judged reported `pass`** — `makeOfflineLabelEchoJudge` defaulted a `state_id` absent from `labels.json` to `{ is_broken: false }`. This is aodex#485's headline defect: 40 states reported passing, 34 of which nothing had ever examined. Unjudged states now resolve to `review` and land in their own `unjudged[]` rollup bucket — deliberately not `reviews[]`, which is flake-budgeted and would have let a single unjudged state roll up clean (obj 32-01)
- **The offline judge fabricated a score** — it returned `matches_expected` and `confidence: 0.99` for a comparison it never performed, having read only the `state_id`. It now emits neither and tags `evidence: 'label'` instead. `confidence` could not simply be dropped: `validateJudgeResult` required it, so removal would have failed every offline state into `review`. Validation is now evidence-aware — `vision` requires the scoring fields, `label` forbids them, and the legacy no-`evidence` shape keeps its original rules byte-for-byte (obj 32-02)
- **An offline pass could retire a human visual check** — verifier Step 8c removed a surface from the Step 9 `human_verification:` list on a bare `verdict: pass`, so a labels lookup could cancel the human review that would have caught what it never looked at. Only `gate: 'binding' AND verdict: pass` may now retire a check; `advisory` never does, and `unjudged[]` states stay queued regardless of gate or verdict (obj 32-03)
- **A failing run exited 0** — a CI step calling the gate saw success no matter what it found. `verdict: fail` now exits 1; `pass`/`pass-with-reviews` exit 0; the not-found/invalid shapes still exit 0 so Step 8c's "never a hard fail" contract holds. Uses `process.exitCode` rather than `process.exit()` so the rollup JSON flushes before exit (obj 32-04)
- **The gate never ran at all** — verifier Step 8c invoked `verify flutter-ui-eval "$OBJECTIVE"`, passing an objective id where a manifest path was expected. It returned `{ error: 'manifest/captureResults not found' }`, exited 0, and routed to SKIPPED. Every fix above was inert in production until this was corrected (obj 33-02)
- **`buildManifestStub` emitted the key the engine cannot read** — the planner's stub seeded states keyed `id` while the engine reads `state_id`, so a stub-derived manifest resolved `state_id: undefined` for every state. The hand-built test fixture used `state_id`, matching the engine rather than the generator, which is why the suite never saw it (obj 32-02)
- **`workflows/ui-eval.md` documented `*.yaml` manifests** — the engine parses JSON and bootstrap writes `*.manifest.json` (obj 33-03)

### Added
- **`flutter-ui-eval-resolve.cjs`** — `resolveUIEvalTarget(cwd, arg)` accepts a manifest path *or* an objective id and returns one of four honest statuses: `resolved`, `absent`, `invalid`, `not_applicable`. A `.yaml` manifest resolves to `invalid`, never `absent` — "the file is right there but unparseable" and "nothing here" are different facts, and collapsing them is how the original defect stayed invisible (obj 33-01)
- **`gate: 'binding' | 'advisory'`** on the rollup — the run's standing, independent of its verdict. `binding` only on `--judge live`; the offline default is a labels lookup and says so (obj 32-03)
- **`evidence: 'vision' | 'label'`** on every judged state, so a consumer reading one state's detail need not cross-reference the run-level `judge` field (obj 32-02)
- **Four-resolution routing in verifier Step 8c** — `absent` reports `? MISSING` and keeps the surface on the human list; `invalid` raises a `gaps:` entry, because a broken gate is a defect rather than an absence (obj 33-03)
- **`--judge` value validation** — an unrecognised value is now a usage error instead of a silent fallback to the offline judge (obj 32-03)

### Known limitations
- **`gate: 'binding'` requires credentials that may not exist.** It needs `--judge live` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` + `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`). No repository secret is configured on this repo; org-level secrets return HTTP 403 to a non-admin, so their absence cannot be concluded from a developer machine and must be checked from inside a CI run. Until then every run is `advisory` and none can retire a human check.
- **The vision judge is not proven against a live model.** All tests inject a deterministic fake at `callVisionJudge`. That proves the resolve → load → score → route → exit-code pipeline end to end; it does not prove a real vision model returns well-formed Shape-C.
- **This repo has no objective with a `type: ui` + `stack: flutter` TRD**, so the gate correctly resolves `not_applicable` here. It reaches `resolved` only against a Flutter consumer repo or a synthetic fixture.


## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-19

Remediation of the **Autonomy Blocker Audit** (2026-08-18) — a measured study of
2,746 Claude Code sessions / 438,941 assistant turns across two machines, which
found 5,473 autonomy-blocking events affecting 56.4% of sessions.

Objectives 27–31. The headline defect: DevFlow's own gates were blocking
DevFlow's own agents. `.planning/.skill-active` is gitignored, so a git worktree
checks out every tracked `.planning` file but never the marker — meaning **77.2%
of all edit-gate denials hit sanctioned subagents**, and 71% of skill-invoking
sessions were gated inside their own skill.

> **Upgrade note:** hooks execute from the plugin cache, so these fixes take
> effect only once this version is installed and `sync-runtime` re-mirrors.
> Verify with `df-tools session-audit --since 2026-08-19`.

### Added
- **`df-tools session-audit`** — classifies autonomy-blocking events from session transcripts. This is the acceptance test for the whole programme: it separates `devflow_owned_events` from harness-owned ones so improvements can be measured rather than asserted (51c7766)
- **`df-tools transcript-export`** — compact per-session index written before retention cleanup deletes transcripts. 60 sessions compress to ~19KB; 164 sessions were already lost before this existed. `--full` copies raw transcripts (51c7766)
- **`df-tools context`** — recomputes context composition (tool results vs tool-call inputs vs images) and per-turn context distribution (173c7f0)
- **`df-tools telemetry`** — one status-facing view over overrides, stuck-loop state and blocking events, emitting advisories rather than raw counts (81796d6)
- **`df-tools override --gate <g> --reason <why>`** — structured, logged gate override replacing prose phrases and env vars. A reason is mandatory; five overrides of one gate surface as `needs_rescoping` (68bd573)
- **No-progress guard** (`guard-no-progress.js`) — detects the same tool called with identical arguments repeatedly. Warns at 3, escalates to `ask` at 5, resets when the approach varies. Step limits fire only after the budget is spent; this inspects whether steps change anything (c6c1a74)
- **Escalation policy** (`references/escalation-policy.md`) — trigger set, bounded burst with de-escalation, and a structured escalation-request protocol for the executor (ac7dc89)
- **Reasoning `effort`** declared per agent. Note Haiku 4.5 rejects the parameter, so only the six agents that never resolve to the haiku tier can carry it — enforced by test (55d1a82)
- **Context discipline reference** — read narrowly, and stop writing whole files into tool arguments (e0a2c81)

### Fixed
- **Edit gate denied worktree-isolated agents** — `.planning/.skill-active` is gitignored, so a worktree could never see the marker written by the main checkout. The gate now resolves the main checkout's `.planning/` by parsing the worktree's `.git` file, and markers carry an 8h TTL so a crashed skill cannot hold the gate open (9571a11, ec83003)
- **Edit gate blocked writes outside the project** — 20.6% of denials targeted the session scratchpad or `/private/tmp`, which DevFlow cannot commit anyway. Path comparison is symlink-aware, since macOS reports cwd as `/private/var/...` while payloads carry `/var/...` (9571a11)
- **Commit gate matched a substring, not an invocation** — any command whose *text* contained the raw-commit phrase was refused, including heredocs writing a file that merely mentions it. Now tokenised, with heredoc bodies and quoted arguments stripped first (c13d5db)
- **Model profile table never bound for skill callers** — profile keys carried a `df-` prefix while three skills passed un-prefixed names, so every lookup silently fell back to `sonnet` regardless of the configured profile. Keys canonicalised, both spellings resolve, unknown agents now warn loudly, and resolution reports tier + concrete model id (d469837)
- **Stale model ids** — `claude-opus-5` / `claude-sonnet-5` / `claude-haiku-4-5`. Not cosmetic: `flutter-ui-eval.cjs` sends this id to the Messages API for the vision judge (d469837)
- **Agent allowlists forbade what prompts instructed** — the executor called `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate` and `AskUserQuestion` while declaring none of them (6037be7)
- **Routing advertised skills the model cannot invoke** — `objective`, `milestone` and `workstreams` are `disable-model-invocation` by design because they mutate planning state. They now appear under an explicit USER-TYPED ONLY heading instead of beside invocable skills (6037be7)
- **Stale documentation** — `CLAUDE.md` listed 8 hooks when 14 ship, and described `MODEL_PROFILES` as hard-coded when it loads from JSON. New objectives also emitted an obsolete `/df:` command prefix (5d0aed8)

### Changed
- Executor and verifier now carry worktree command discipline: the harness worktree guard refuses compound Bash commands it cannot statically verify — including git-less `go test` pipelines — so agents emit one plain command per call (786752d)
- Executor anchors paths to the worktree root and raises timeouts for builds and test suites (68bd573)

### Known limitations
- The harness worktree-isolation guard (2,685 blocked events, the single largest category) is **not DevFlow code** and cannot be fixed here. 1,552 of its refusals contained no git command at all. Mitigated via agent command discipline; reported upstream.
- TRD 27-03 (edit-gate posture) is parked as `DECISION-001` pending re-measurement — the data motivating a posture change predates the marker fix.
- TRD 28-06 (Haiku replay eval) deferred: 63 Haiku turns in the corpus is no basis for placing agents on that tier, and 22.4% of subagent turns already exceed its 200K window.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- **25-02**: `gates.editGate` config knob in gate-edits.js — per-repo `.planning/config.json` `gates.editGate: warn|strict|off`, default strict; `warn` converts ambient-edit deny to ask, `off` disables the gate (85d61b5)

### Added
- **UI design-review layer (advisory)**: a design-critic mode of the UI visual-eval boundary that scores a rendered screen's DEVIATION from the project design system (tokens), UX heuristics, and per-page `design_intent` — answering "is this GOOD design, and how to improve it?". ADVISORY ONLY — it NEVER gates an objective (distinct from the defect judge at verifier Step 8c, which DOES gate).
  - **Phase A** — engine `bin/lib/flutter-ui-design-review.cjs` (buildDesignReviewRequest / parseDesignReviewResponse / validateDesignReview / aggregateDesignReview / formatDesignDebtReport / runDesignReview); CLI `df-tools flutter-ui design-review <manifest> [--live] [--raw]` (one critique per state, writes prioritized `design-review-report.{md,json}`, offline/no-key → states skipped, no crash); `/devflow:design-review` skill + `design-review` workflow (heavy first-run ranked design-debt sweep).
  - **Phase B** — verifier Step 8d (advisory design-review pass on each type:ui/stack:flutter objective's surfaces AFTER the Step 8c defect gate; high/medium debt → advisory notes + candidate todos for FUTURE UI objectives via the existing `/devflow:add-todo` mechanism; NEVER a `gaps:` entry, NEVER alters the verdict); planner `decideDesignReviewDefault` auto-note (`advisory:true`/`gating:false` invariant) + the `## Advisory Design Review (auto-noted)` plan call-out. Cadence: heavy first-run sweep via `/devflow:design-review`; thereafter a lightweight advisory pass per UI objective.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **UI visual-evaluation layer**: a VLM-as-judge that scores rendered UI against per-state `expected` anchors, complementing functional/golden tests by catching first-time defects (overflow, blank-when-data-expected, misalignment) without baseline churn.
  - Engine `bin/lib/flutter-ui-eval.cjs` — validateJudgeResult / aggregateVotes / scoreState (HIGH-severity-only gate) / scoreRun / injectable callVisionJudge; dogfood fixtures.
  - CLI `df-tools verify flutter-ui-eval [--raw]` + `flutter-ui eval|bootstrap`; `df-ui-evaluator` model profile.
  - Integration: `ui-evaluator` agent, `/devflow:ui-eval` skill, `ui-eval` workflow, verifier Step 8c (fail→gaps, pass→drop from human-verify), planner auto-emit + explicit "Visual-Eval Gate" call-out + session tasks for type:ui/stack:flutter objectives.
  - `flutter-ui-eval-bootstrap.cjs` scaffolds the manifest/adapter/Playwright project into any stack:flutter repo.
  - `scoreRun` honors per-state `expect:fail` (known_failing/resolved buckets) so known-broken states don't fail the run while open, but a new fail or an unexpected pass still surfaces.

### Fixed
- **25-01**: correct 4 phantom pre-consolidation skill names in route-intent INTENT_MAP (new-milestone/add-todo/check-todos/audit-milestone → consolidated `/devflow:milestone new`, `/devflow:todo add`, `/devflow:todo list`, `/devflow:milestone audit` forms) (4065a8f)
- **25-01**: tighten VERIFY routing rule to explicit `verify|validate + the|this + noun` intent — generic "check the build"/"test the feature" dev-speech no longer fires (218ae08)
- **25-01**: broaden near-dead adoption router rules for milestone-new/todo-list/gh-sync/discuss-objective with realistic fixture-pinned phrasings (cffca14)

### Removed
- **25-03**: `join-discord` skill pruned — directory deleted, `/devflow:help` catalog entry and USER-GUIDE command-table row removed (9e3f52e, 92db50e)

### Chore

## [2.1.2] - 2026-05-08

Re-release of the v2.1.1 planner fix with manifest version-sync. The v2.1.1 git tag
was placed before the three-manifest tag gate (`455f1bf`) was wired in, so the
release shipped without bumping `package.json`, `plugin.json`, or `marketplace.json`
— plugin managers continued to see 2.1.0. v2.1.2 carries the same planner fix plus
the gate that prevents the same slip going forward.

### Fixed
- **planner**: bound `update_roadmap` edits to target objective's section (#58, 2547065)
  — section boundary rule plus post-write `git diff` self-check; aborts with
  PLANNING INCONCLUSIVE on second cross-bound attempt.

### Added
- **quick-2**: extend tag gate to verify three-manifest version sync (455f1bf)
  — the gate now denies `git tag vX.Y.Z` unless `package.json`, `plugin.json`,
  and the `marketplace.json` plugin entry all carry the matching version.
- **quick-1**: release-on-tag GitHub Actions workflow (046eb34)

### Docs
- record release-on-tag JOB + SUMMARY + STATE (7bf0314, 02510bb)
- record tag-gate version-sync SUMMARY + STATE (b92fa2d, 7eaf8ea)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added — v1.2 milestone (PTY watcher, daemon polish, bidirectional GH sync, workflow polish)

- **PTY support for handoff watcher** — `node-pty` integration in `watcher-shell.cjs`
  closes the TTY-interactive auth gap. `gh auth login`, `doctl auth init`, and similar
  TTY-stdin-required flows now work through the daemon. Token-passing schema
  (`inputs.secrets[]` with `value_source: stash | env`) lets the daemon answer prompts
  from the user's environment. Deny-list (`sudo`, `su -`) preserved. macOS-first;
  Linux out-of-box; Windows best-effort. Includes `postinstall` chmod for
  spawn-helper binaries.
- **Daemon polish bundle** —
  - **OS notifications** via `osascript`/`notify-send` on dispatch start/complete
    (gated by `daemon.notifications` config flag, default off).
  - **Auto-launch** via `devflow-watch install-service` / `uninstall-service` —
    user-domain `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` (macOS) / `~/.config/systemd/user/`
    (Linux) plist/unit generation.
  - **Multi-project watching** — daemon iterates `watching: []` array; new
    `devflow-watch add-project <path>` / `remove-project <path>` CLI; serial
    dispatch round-robin (no worker pool).
  - **Status-line indicator** — `statusline.js` shows `▶ watcher` / `⏸ N pending`
    when daemon active, hides cleanly when off.
  - **Cross-shell support** — `lib/wrappers/{bash,fish,powershell}.cjs` modules
    behind a `getWrapper(shell)` factory. bash/zsh byte-identical preserved;
    fish + PowerShell new. nushell deferred.
- **Bidirectional GitHub sync** —
  - **`df-tools gh pull <objective> [--apply]`** — inbound poll: reads GH issue
    state, detects drift vs disk frontmatter (status, labels, assignees, milestone),
    optionally writes changed fields back to OBJECTIVE.md.
  - **3-way conflict detection** — `--resolve={disk,gh,merge}` flag for explicit
    resolution; non-zero exit on unresolved conflict.
  - **Sync state tracking** — `.planning/.gh-sync-state.json` with atomic
    read/write; integrated into both push (`gh sync`) and pull paths.
- **Configurable kind/work defaults table** — 3-tier resolution:
  project (`.planning/defaults-table.md`) > org (`~/.claude/devflow/defaults-table.md`)
  > bundled. New `df-tools defaults-table init --scope=org|project [--force] [--dry-run]`
  CLI scaffolds editable copies. `intent resolve` output now includes
  `cell_provenance` showing which tier supplied each cell.
- **Token efficiency / ambient mode (Phase 1+2)** —
  - **Skill consolidation 28→14** via `df-tools skill-route`: `/devflow:objective`,
    `/devflow:milestone`, `/devflow:status`, `/devflow:todo` now consolidate prior
    sub-skills with deprecation redirects.
  - **Prompt extraction to references** — duplicated agent-prompt content
    (debugging methodology, goal-backward methodology, TRD spec, research tooling,
    stub patterns) moved to shared references; saves ~25-55k tokens per build.
  - **Authoritative routing** (`route-intent.js` + new `classify-session.js`
    SessionStart hook) — DevFlow project detection injects routing decision table
    as system context. `gate-edits` hook converted to strict-DENY-by-default in
    ambient mode; allowed only with `.planning/.skill-active` marker, override
    phrase, or `DEVFLOW_SKIP_EDIT_GATE=1`.
  - **`/devflow:micro` skill** — sub-30-LOC, single-file changes; ~2k token target.
    `df-tools micro start|commit|abort` CLI manages skill marker.
  - **Auto-init detection** — non-DevFlow projects get an init offer at session
    start when isSubstantive (git>7d OR >10 files; manifest present; not scratch)
    AND not previously declined. New `df-tools project-state`, `project-decline`,
    `project-accept`, `global-config` CLIs.
  - **Default-on safety nets** — verifier always-on; `df-tools verify trd-pre`
    cheap pre-flight checker (req coverage, task completeness, dep cycles, scope
    sanity); `df-tools detect novel-domain` and `detect brownfield-map` helpers.
    Confidence frontmatter dropped in favor of per-task `caution` attribute.
- **Workflow-impediment fixes** —
  - **`df-tools init --branch=<name>`** flag — defaults to current; missing-state
    errors with hint instead of silent history walking.
  - **`df-tools project-hygiene check`** — read-only scan for objectives whose
    `parent_issue` or `github_issue` resolves to a different repo than PROJECT.md
    `github_repo` (misfiled candidates).
  - **`df-tools project-hygiene move <id> --to=<path>`** — atomic copy + verify
    (file count + bytes match) + remove source. Verify-fail rolls back dest.
  - **`df-tools project-hygiene archive [--apply <name>]`** — flags retired
    repos (`archived: true` frontmatter or last commit > 6mo); apply moves
    `.planning/` to `<workspace>/archived-projects/<name>/` and emits
    `gh repo archive` command without executing it (preserves user authority).
- **OBJECTIVE.md auto-scaffold** — `bootstrapObjectiveMd` + `backfillAllObjectives`
  helpers run on every `df-tools init plan-objective` / `init execute-objective`,
  generating minimal `OBJECTIVE.md` stubs from PROJECT.md `default_work` and
  ROADMAP goal lines for any objective directory missing one.
- **Roadmap reconciliation** — `df-tools sync-roadmap` (auto-runs at objective
  complete) and `df-tools gh sync` keep planning artifacts and remote state in
  sync without manual invocation.
- **Unified `df-tools check-todos`** — standup-format aggregator across all
  DevFlow surfaces with cache layer, lane assignment (Now / Soon / Blocked /
  Ideas), and per-source attribution.
- **Program-aware TUI viewer** (`df-tools tui`) — terminal renderer for objective
  state with hand-rolled ANSI; no library dependency.
- **Cross-repo awareness** — `df-tools awareness scan-peer` (peer branches)
  and `awareness scan-org` (org-level views) with cache layer; surfaces during
  planning to flag cross-repo work.
- **Initiative context layer** — `df-tools initiatives list|show` reads
  `.planning/initiatives/` and feeds the planner with cross-objective context.
- **Duplicate-work detection** — `df-tools dup-detect` runs at plan + execute
  init; flags overlapping objectives with 4-option resolution flow.
- **Per-objective benchmarking** — `df-tools benchmark per-objective` and
  `benchmark summary`. Walks subagent JSONL transcripts, attributes by
  objective via prompt regex, computes weighted dollar cost using Anthropic
  prompt-cache pricing (cache reads 0.1×, cache writes 1.25×, output 5×).
  Auto-detects v1.X-obj-N attribution via merge commit subject scanning.
  Pure Node.js — zero LLM cost to run.

### Added — v1.1 milestone (handoff watcher, kind/work intent model)

- **Seamless handoff watcher (`devflow-watch`)** — local daemon that
  executes interactive and shell-flow commands in the user's interactive
  shell so Claude Code can keep executing without instructing the user
  to paste `! cmd`. New CLI subcommands: `start`, `stop`, `status`,
  `logs`, `version`. Approach B from `docs/PROPOSAL-handoff-watcher.md`.
- **`gate-interactive` hook is daemon-aware**: when watcher PID is live,
  deny message says "queued for daemon — continue with other work" and
  does not instruct paste. Falls back to original Approach A
  ("tell user `! cmd`") when daemon is absent. Hook is useful in either
  mode.
- **13 new shell-flow patterns** in the curated allowlist: `nvm use`,
  executes interactive and shell-flow commands in the user's interactive
  shell so Claude Code can keep executing without instructing the user
  to paste `! cmd`. New CLI subcommands: `start`, `stop`, `status`,
  `logs`, `version`. Approach B from `docs/PROPOSAL-handoff-watcher.md`.
- **`gate-interactive` hook is daemon-aware**: when watcher PID is live,
  deny message says "queued for daemon — continue with other work" and
  does not instruct paste. Falls back to original Approach A
  ("tell user `! cmd`") when daemon is absent. Hook is useful in either
  mode.
- **13 new shell-flow patterns** in the curated allowlist: `nvm use`,
  `nvm install`, `pyenv shell`, `pyenv install`, `conda activate`,
  `direnv exec`, `direnv allow`, `mise use`, `mise install`, `mise run`,
  `asdf shell`, `asdf install`, `rbenv shell`. Plus `aws sso login` added
  to the TTY-interactive set. Pattern count 9 → 23.
- **`route-results.js` UserPromptSubmit hook** — when the daemon
  completes a queued command, this hook injects the result into Claude's
  next turn as `additionalContext`. Closes the
  Claude-continues-executing loop. Truncates per record, honors TTL
  (default 1h), special-cases rejected/timeout with "Do NOT retry"
  guidance.
- **User-extensible allowlist** at `~/.devflow/devflow-watch-allow.json`
  — JSON file with `commands: [{pattern, label, skipIf?}]`. Combined
  with the curated default. Sanity-check deny list (sudo, su -, rm -rf /,
  fork bombs, curl|bash, wget|bash) always rejects.
- **`docs/handoff-watcher-guide.md`** — user-facing guide covering
  install/start/stop, allowlist customization, security model,
  troubleshooting.
- **`docs/PROPOSAL-handoff-watcher.md`** — design rationale for the
  watcher daemon (Approach B from the seamless-handoff proposal).
- **Two-axis intent model: `kind` + `work`.** Every project declares what it IS (`kind`: `api | app | library | ui-lib | cli | plugin`) on PROJECT.md; every objective declares what it DOES (`work`: `feature | port | refactor | foundation | bugfix | prototype | spike`) on OBJECTIVE.md. The planner reads both and applies a 42-cell `(kind, work) → defaults` lookup table to derive TDD posture, planning depth, model profile, and verification rigor — replacing the previous silent "Can you write `expect(fn(input))`?" heuristic. Defaults are visible at planning time (printed before TRD generation) and overridable at four levels: TRD frontmatter > OBJECTIVE.md `overrides` > CLAUDE.md user playbook directives > defaults table. Postures grounded in Feathers (characterization tests for refactor), Beck/Fowler (TDD), ThoughtWorks (test pyramid), Pact (consumer-driven contracts), and visual-regression industry tooling.
- **PROJECT.md `default_work` field.** Optional. Sets the default `work` value inherited by objectives that don't declare their own. The planner emits a louder message when an objective inherits this default, surfacing the inheritance source and inviting override so silent inheritance can't mask a wrong default.
- **CLAUDE.md absorption.** The planner now reads `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `./CLAUDE.md` for sections matching TDD/Test/Quality/Scope policy headings, and applies the directives as overrides on the defaults table. Conservative pattern matching avoids false positives.
- **`df-tools intent resolve --objective <id>`.** New CLI subcommand that returns the resolved configuration as JSON with provenance metadata for each field. Used by the planner; available for inspection and tooling.
- **`/devflow:health --migrate`.** One-time migration for projects created before the kind/work model. Adds `kind` to PROJECT.md and `work` to OBJECTIVE.md frontmatter, with backup at `.planning/.migrate-backup-{timestamp}/` before any write. Idempotent. Supports `--dry-run`.
- **Intent override flags on `/devflow:plan-objective` and `/devflow:build`.** `--work TYPE`, `--tdd POSTURE`, `--depth LEVEL`, `--model PROFILE` for one-shot per-objective overrides. Persisted to OBJECTIVE.md so the executor honors them.
- **OBJECTIVE.md template.** New file at `plugins/devflow/devflow/templates/objective.md` — the schema is now explicit; previously objective metadata was implicit.
- **Defaults table reference.** New machine-readable file at `plugins/devflow/devflow/references/defaults-table.md` with all 42 (kind, work) cells.
- See `docs/PROPOSAL-kind-and-work.md` for full design rationale and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-kind-and-work.md` for the wave/TRD breakdown.

### Changed
- Terminology rename: **Phase → Objective**, **Plan (noun) → Job**
  - New hierarchy: Milestone → Objective → Job → Task
  - "Objective" replaces "Phase" — outcome-oriented, not sequential
  - "Job" replaces "Plan" (the document/work package) — separates work from planning activity
  - "plan" as a verb is preserved everywhere (planning, planner, /df:plan-objective)
  - `.planning/` directory unchanged (generic activity name)
  - All CLI commands, config keys, JSON output keys, file names updated
  - PLAN.md → JOB.md, .planning/phases/ → .planning/objectives/

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- **BREAKING — distribution**: DevFlow now ships exclusively as a Claude Code plugin. Install via `/plugin marketplace add AO-Cyber-Systems/devflow-claude` then `/plugin install devflow@aocyber`, or use the Claude Desktop plugin UI. The `npx @ao-cyber-systems/devflow-cc` install path is removed.
- Bundled runtime under the plugin source: `devflow/{bin,workflows,references,templates}` → `plugins/devflow/devflow/`. A new SessionStart hook (`sync-runtime.js`) mirrors the bundled runtime to `~/.claude/devflow/` on each session start when `.plugin-version` differs, so existing `@~/.claude/devflow/*` references in skills, agents, and workflows resolve unchanged.
- Hooks migrated into the plugin manifest (`plugins/devflow/hooks/hooks.json`) and auto-register on plugin enable. statusLine moves to `plugin.json`'s `statusLine` field. No more manual `settings.json` patching.

### Removed
- `bin/install.js` (the npx installer), `scripts/build-hooks.js`, `hooks/dist/`, `hooks/check-update.js`, and `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.
- `/devflow:update` and `/devflow:reapply-patches` skills — these existed to manage drift in the npm-installer's deployment; under plugin distribution `/plugin update` handles versioning.

### Migration
- Users with a prior npm install must remove legacy `~/.claude/hooks/df-*.js` files and clean stale entries (DevFlow `hooks` blocks and `statusLine`) from `~/.claude/settings.json` before installing the plugin. See README "Migrating from a previous npm install".

---

*History below is from the original GSD project.*

## [1.20.4] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- Executor agents now update ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md after each plan completes — previously both documents stayed unchecked throughout milestone execution
- New `requirements mark-complete` CLI command enables per-plan requirement tracking instead of waiting for phase completion
- Executor final commit includes ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md

## [1.20.3] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Milestone audit now cross-references three independent sources (VERIFICATION.md + SUMMARY frontmatter + REQUIREMENTS.md traceability) instead of single-source phase status checks
- Orphaned requirements (in traceability table but absent from all phase VERIFICATIONs) detected and forced to `unsatisfied`
- Integration checker receives milestone requirement IDs and maps findings to affected requirements
- `complete-milestone` gates on requirements completion before archival — surfaces unchecked requirements with proceed/audit/abort options
- `plan-milestone-gaps` updates REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table (phase assignments, checkbox resets, coverage count) and includes it in commit
- Gemini CLI: escape `${VAR}` shell variables in agent bodies to prevent template validation failures

## [1.20.2] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Requirements tracking chain now strips bracket syntax (`[REQ-01, REQ-02]` → `REQ-01, REQ-02`) across all agents
- Verifier cross-references requirement IDs from PLAN frontmatter instead of only grepping REQUIREMENTS.md by phase number
- Orphaned requirements (mapped to phase in REQUIREMENTS.md but unclaimed by any plan) are detected and flagged

### Changed
- All `requirements` references across planner, templates, and workflows enforce MUST/REQUIRED/CRITICAL language — no more passive suggestions
- Plan checker now **fails** (blocking, not warning) when any roadmap requirement is absent from all plans
- Researcher receives phase-specific requirement IDs and must output a `<phase_requirements>` mapping table
- Phase requirement IDs extracted from ROADMAP and passed through full chain: researcher → planner → checker → executor → verifier
- Verification report requirements table expanded with Source Plan, Description, and Evidence columns

## [1.20.1] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Auto-mode (`--auto`) now survives context compaction by persisting `workflow.auto_advance` to config.json on disk
- Checkpoints no longer block auto-mode: human-verify auto-approves, decision auto-selects first option (human-action still stops for auth gates)
- Plan-phase now passes `--auto` flag when spawning execute-phase
- Auto-advance clears on milestone complete to prevent runaway chains

## [1.20.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- `/df:health` command — validates `.planning/` directory integrity with `--repair` flag for auto-fixing config.json and STATE.md
- `--full` flag for `/df:quick` — enables plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification on quick tasks
- `--auto` flag wired from `/df:new-project` through the full phase chain (discuss → plan → execute)
- Auto-advance chains phase execution across full milestones when `workflow.auto_advance` is enabled

### Fixed
- Plans created without user context — `/df:plan-phase` warns when no CONTEXT.md exists, `/df:discuss-phase` warns when plans already exist (#253)
- OpenCode installer converts `general-purpose` subagent type to OpenCode's `general`
- `/df:complete-milestone` respects `commit_docs` setting when merging branches
- Phase directories tracked in git via `.gitkeep` files

## [1.19.2] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- User-level default settings via `~/.gsd/defaults.json` — set GSD defaults across all projects
- Per-agent model overrides — customize which Claude model each agent uses

### Changed
- Completed milestone phase directories are now archived for cleaner project structure
- Wave execution diagram added to README for clearer parallelization visualization

### Fixed
- OpenCode local installs now write config to `./.opencode/` instead of overwriting global `~/.config/opencode/`
- Large JSON payloads write to temp files to prevent truncation in tool calls
- Phase heading matching now supports `####` depth
- Phase padding normalized in insert command
- ESM conflicts prevented by renaming gsd-tools.js to .cjs
- Config directory paths quoted in hook templates for local installs
- Settings file corruption prevented by using Write tool for file creation
- Plan-phase autocomplete fixed by removing "execution" from description
- Executor now has scope boundary and attempt limit to prevent runaway loops

## [1.19.1] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- Auto-advance pipeline: `--auto` flag on `discuss-phase` and `plan-phase` chains discuss → plan → execute without stopping. Also available as `workflow.auto_advance` config setting

### Fixed
- Phase transition routing now routes to `discuss-phase` (not `plan-phase`) when no CONTEXT.md exists — consistent across all workflows (#530)
- ROADMAP progress table plan counts are now computed from disk instead of LLM-edited — deterministic "X/Y Complete" values (#537)
- Verifier uses ROADMAP Success Criteria directly instead of deriving verification truths from the Goal field (#538)
- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability updates when a phase completes
- STATE.md updates after discuss-phase completes (#556)
- AskUserQuestion headers enforced to 12-char max to prevent UI truncation (#559)
- Agent model resolution returns `inherit` instead of hardcoded `opus` (#558)

## [1.19.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- Brave Search integration for researchers (requires BRAVE_API_KEY environment variable)
- GitHub issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- Security policy for responsible disclosure
- Auto-labeling workflow for new issues

### Fixed
- UAT gaps and debug sessions now auto-resolve after gap-closure phase execution (#580)
- Fall back to ROADMAP.md when phase directory missing (#521)
- Template hook paths for OpenCode/Gemini runtimes (#585)
- Accept both `##` and `###` phase headers, detect malformed ROADMAPs (#598, #599)
- Use `{phase_num}` instead of ambiguous `{phase}` for filenames (#601)
- Add package.json to prevent ESM inheritance issues (#602)

## [1.18.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- `--auto` flag for `/df:new-project` — runs research → requirements → roadmap automatically after config questions. Expects idea document via @ reference (e.g., `/df:new-project --auto @prd.md`)

### Fixed
- Windows: SessionStart hook now spawns detached process correctly
- Windows: Replaced HEREDOC with literal newlines for git commit compatibility
- Research decision from `/df:new-milestone` now persists to config.json

## [1.17.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **gsd-tools verification suite**: `verify plan-structure`, `verify phase-completeness`, `verify references`, `verify commits`, `verify artifacts`, `verify key-links` — deterministic structural checks
- **gsd-tools frontmatter CRUD**: `frontmatter get/set/merge/validate` — safe YAML frontmatter operations with schema validation
- **gsd-tools template fill**: `template fill summary/plan/verification` — pre-filled document skeletons
- **gsd-tools state progression**: `state advance-plan`, `state update-progress`, `state record-metric`, `state add-decision`, `state add-blocker`, `state resolve-blocker`, `state record-session` — automates STATE.md updates
- **Local patch preservation**: Installer now detects locally modified GSD files, backs them up to `gsd-local-patches/`, and creates a manifest for restoration
- `/df:reapply-patches` command to merge local modifications back after GSD updates

### Changed
- Agents (executor, planner, plan-checker, verifier) now use gsd-tools for state updates and verification instead of manual markdown parsing
- `/df:update` workflow now notifies about backed-up local patches and suggests `/df:reapply-patches`

### Fixed
- Added workaround for Claude Code `classifyHandoffIfNeeded` bug that causes false agent failures — execute-phase and quick workflows now spot-check actual output before reporting failure

## [1.16.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- 10 new gsd-tools CLI commands that replace manual AI orchestration of mechanical operations:
  - `phase add <desc>` — append phase to roadmap + create directory
  - `phase insert <after> <desc>` — insert decimal phase
  - `phase remove <N> [--force]` — remove phase with full renumbering
  - `phase complete <N>` — mark done, update state + roadmap, detect milestone end
  - `roadmap analyze` — unified roadmap parser with disk status
  - `milestone complete <ver> [--name]` — archive roadmap/requirements/audit
  - `validate consistency` — check phase numbering and disk/roadmap sync
  - `progress [json|table|bar]` — render progress in various formats
  - `todo complete <file>` — move todo from pending to completed
  - `scaffold [context|uat|verification|phase-dir]` — template generation

### Changed
- Workflows now delegate deterministic operations to gsd-tools CLI, reducing token usage and errors:
  - `remove-phase.md`: 13 manual steps → 1 CLI call + confirm + commit
  - `add-phase.md`: 6 manual steps → 1 CLI call + state update
  - `insert-phase.md`: 7 manual steps → 1 CLI call + state update
  - `complete-milestone.md`: archival delegated to `milestone complete`
  - `progress.md`: roadmap parsing delegated to `roadmap analyze`

### Fixed
- Execute-phase now correctly spawns `gsd-executor` subagents instead of generic task agents
- `commit_docs=false` setting now respected in all `.planning/` commit paths (execute-plan, debugger, reference docs all route through gsd-tools CLI)
- Execute-phase orchestrator no longer bloats context by embedding file content — passes paths instead, letting subagents read in their fresh context
- Windows: Normalized backslash paths in gsd-tools invocations (contributed by @rmindel)

## [1.15.0] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- Optimized workflow context loading to eliminate redundant file reads, reducing token usage by ~5,000-10,000 tokens per workflow execution

## [1.14.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- Context-optimizing parsing commands in gsd-tools (`phase-plan-index`, `state-snapshot`, `summary-extract`) — reduces agent context usage by returning structured JSON instead of raw file content

- Explicit scope guardrail prevents scope creep during discussion — captures deferred ideas without acting on them
- CONTEXT.md template restructured for decisions (domain boundary, decisions by category, Claude's discretion, deferred ideas)
- Downstream awareness: discuss-phase now explicitly documents that CONTEXT.md feeds researcher and planner agents
- `/df:plan-phase` now integrates research — spawns `gsd-phase-researcher` before planning unless research exists or `--skip-research` flag used

## [1.5.18] - 2026-01-16

  - `discuss-milestone` is now required before `new-milestone` (creates context file)
  - `research-project` is milestone-aware — focuses on new features, ignores already-validated requirements
  - `create-roadmap` continues phase numbering from previous milestone
  - Flow: complete → discuss → new-milestone → research → requirements → roadmap

### Fixed

- Roadmap and planning workflows enhanced with goal-backward analysis

### Removed
- Obsolete templates (`checkpoint-resume.md`, `subagent-task-prompt.md`) — logic now lives in subagents

### Fixed
- Updated remaining `general-purpose` subagent references to use `gsd-executor`

## [1.5.6] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- README: Separated flow into distinct steps (1 → 1.5 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5) making `research-project` clearly optional and `define-requirements` required

## [1.5.3] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- **execute-phase narration**: Orchestrator now describes what each wave builds before spawning agents, and summarizes what was built after completion. No more staring at opaque status updates.
- **new-project flow**: Now offers two paths — research first (recommended) or define requirements directly (fast path for familiar domains)
- **define-requirements**: Works without prior research. Gathers requirements through conversation when FEATURES.md doesn't exist.

### Removed
- Dead `/df:status` command (referenced abandoned background agent model)
- Unused `agent-history.md` template
- `_archive/` directory with old execute-phase version

## [1.5.2] - 2026-01-15

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-14

### Changed
- Research agents write their own files directly (STACK.md, FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PITFALLS.md) instead of returning results to orchestrator
- Slimmed principles.md and load it dynamically in core commands

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- New `/df:research-project` command for pre-roadmap ecosystem research — spawns parallel agents to investigate stack, features, architecture, and pitfalls before you commit to a roadmap
- New `/df:define-requirements` command for scoping v1 requirements from research findings — transforms "what exists in this domain" into "what we're building"
- Requirements traceability: phases now map to specific requirement IDs with 100% coverage validation

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** New project flow is now: `new-project → research-project → define-requirements → create-roadmap`
- Roadmap creation now requires REQUIREMENTS.md and validates all v1 requirements are mapped to phases
- Simplified questioning in new-project to four essentials (vision, core priority, boundaries, constraints)

## [1.4.29] - 2026-01-14
